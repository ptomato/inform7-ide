Phrases concerning rules</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>The &quot;ignore&quot; phrase is only one of a suite. The full list is:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">ignore ...rule...
<br>reinstate ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;reinstate&quot; phrase simply reverses any previous &quot;ignore&quot; of the same rule, and is otherwise not useful.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">reject the result of ...rule...
<br>accept the result of ...rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Some rules produce results, as we shall see in the next section, but they can be set so that whatever result they produce will be ignored. Again, &quot;accept ...&quot; simply undoes a previous &quot;reject ...&quot; and otherwise has no effect.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">substitute ...first rule... for ...second rule...
<br>restore the original ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whenever the second rule is to be invoked - from any rulebook, or as a result of any &quot;follow&quot; instruction - invoke the first one instead. Again, &quot;restore ...&quot; simply undoes the effect of an earlier &quot;substitute&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">move ...first rule... to before/after ...second rule...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This causes the first rule to be ignored whenever it turns up in the ordinary way, but to be invoked either immediately before or immediately after the second rule whenever that second rule is invoked. In effect, it cuts out the first rule from wherever it was, and glues it onto the second. Note that there is no obligation for the first rule to begin in the same rulebook(s) as the second, so this can be used to slot in a wholly new rule, perhaps only if certain circumstances hold.
<p>
<p>These rule-changing instructions allow apparently casual sentences to wreak havoc with the model world. This, for instance, is quite the recipe for mayhem and perplexity:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A procedural rule: reject the result of the before rules; ignore the after rules; move the after rules to before the before rules.
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a setting where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions. Here we provide some training wheels to help them learn to communicate.
<p>
<p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and used anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules; and in the third part, we play with a change to the situation which leads us to want to rearrange the rulebook.

This might take any of a number of forms, but for the sake of example we\'ll use an easy way out:]\n\nInclude Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short. Include Menus by Emily Short. Include Basic Help Menu by Emily Short.\n\nAfter taking inventory when novice mode is used: say "To get rid of any of these objects, [bold type]drop[roman type] it."\n\nA thing can be examined or unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.\n\nA thing can be seen or unseen. A thing is usually unseen.\n\nDefinition: a thing is relevant if it is seen and it is visible. Before printing the name of something (called the target): now the target is seen; if novice mode is used, say "[bold type]".

"Though not always the most stimulating of environments, the station is far from your ex-wife and most of the things in the world that annoy you, namely the other 6+ billion people. There is a second room to the south." The station contains a radio. The radio is a device. It is fixed in place.\n\nSouth of the Station is Sitting Room. The description of the Sitting Room is "Just big enough for a very [comfortable chair]." The Sitting Room contains an enterable supporter called a comfortable chair. The chair is scenery. A monograph about penguins is in the Sitting Room.\n\nBlistering Cold is a room. "It is white out here and very very very cold." The white door is a door. "[The white door] leads to [the other side of the white door]."  It is west of the Blistering Cold and east of the Antarctic Research Station.\n\nPart 3 - Altered realities\n\nThis is the suggestion that he taste stuff rule:\n\tsay "  [bold type]taste[roman type] [the random visible thing]".\n\nThis is the suggestion that he smell things rule:\n\tsay "  [bold type]smell[roman type] [the list of relevant unexamined things]".\n\nProcedural rule when the player is drugged:\n\tignore the suggestion that he take things rule;\n\tignore the suggestion that he check inventory rule;\n\t\tignore the suggestion that he open things rule;\n\tignore the suggestion that he turn things on rule;\n\tignore the suggestion that he put things on rule;\n\tignore the suggestion that he go places rule;\n\tignore the suggestion that he enter doors rule;\n\tsubstitute the suggestion that he smell things rule for the suggestion that he examine things rule;\n\tmove the suggestion that he taste stuff rule to before the suggestion that he ask for help rule.\n\nA person can be drugged or sober. The player is sober.\n\nThe little purple mushroom is carried by the player. The mushroom is edible. After eating the little purple mushroom: say "Whoa!"; now the player is drugged. The description of the mushroom is "Pretty!"\n\nTest me with "i / x radio / x door / s / i / drop mushroom / get mushroom / x chair / x monograph / sit in chair / get up / n / open door / enter door / eat mushroom / w / s".\n');
