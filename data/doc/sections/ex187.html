<p>Let us suppose that somebody gets off the train, after all, so that a second scene follows on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Brief Encounter is a scene. Brief Encounter begins when Train Stop ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect of this is that they occur in sequence. If we add a third to the chain of scenes:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Village Exploration is a scene. Village Exploration begins when Brief Encounter ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...we find another chance to fool ourselves: if we check the Scenes index again, we can see the linkages between these scenes, but we also see that Brief Encounter never ends (despite its name). All we have said is that another scene begins where Brief Encounter leaves off, but it never does, so this is moot.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;now Beauty is passive&quot; line prevents her from making any conversation of her own on a turn when we've spoken to her. This keeps the conversation from progressing too quickly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of telling an awake beauty about something: try asking the noun about it.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of asking an asleep person about something:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage Proposal ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Conversation is 0.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Marriage Proposal:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Beauty is active
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Conversation
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[quip entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make no decision;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>After we've generated any spontaneous conversation, we return her to her regular active state.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn: now Beauty is active.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Marriage Proposal ends: end the game saying &quot;This is going to take some explaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;x beauty / wake beauty / pour water on beauty / ask beauty about sleep / z / ask beauty about marriage&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we have a scenario in which the player can ask her some questions out of order if he really wants to, but the scene will not end until the basic conversation topics have been exhausted. If we wanted to add some other chit-chat, not as part of the main conversation strand, but by way of optional enrichment, we might make a second conversation table and record alternative outcomes in it.
