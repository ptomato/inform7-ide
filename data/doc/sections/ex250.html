<p>A condition is a yes/no decision, but we can also take decisions where the result is a value. Suppose we want to create a concept of the &quot;grand prize&quot;, which will have different values at different times in play. Each time the &quot;grand prize&quot; is referred to, Inform will have to decide what its value is, and the following tells Inform how to make that decision:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which treasure is the grand prize:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Dark Room has been visited then decide on the silver bars;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the plover's egg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have to say what kind the answer will be: here it's a kind of thing called &quot;treasure&quot; (which we're supposing has already been created), and as it turns out only two treasures are ever eligible anyway (we're also supposing that the plover's egg and the silver bars are treasures already created, of course). And note also that the phrase must in all case end with a &quot;decide on ...&quot; to say what the answer is.
<p>
<p>Now that we have &quot;grand prize&quot; created, we can use it just as we would use any other value, so for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking the grand prize then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the target score: ...
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>Suppose we have a game in which the player can climb through windows which overlook rooms below. We want him to be allowed to climb out windows to reach a room on the same level or at most one level lower than the one he's on; otherwise, he should get a refusal, saying that he would break his neck.
<p>
<p>To figure out the height distance between the start room and the destination room, we might have a repeat loop look at all the directions one has to follow along the &quot;best route&quot; path between the two rooms, and record any ups and downs; then subtract the number of &quot;up&quot; steps from the number of &quot;down&quot; steps, and report what remains.

<p>Now we just have to create windows and some action rules for interacting with them...
<p>

<p>
<p>Here we must anticipate a little from next chapter, and provide ourselves with a way of keeping track of how windows and rooms relate to one another:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Overlooking relates various windows to various rooms. The verb to overlook (it overlooks, they overlook, it overlooked, it is overlooked, it is overlooking) implies the overlooking relation. The initial appearance of a window is usually &quot;[The item described] overlooks [the list of rooms overlooked by the item described].&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Square Keep is above the Winding Staircase. The Winding Staircase is above the Motte. A crown and a broken sword are in the Motte. The Bailey is west of the Motte.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The long window is in the Keep. The long window overlooks the Bailey and the Motte. The narrow window is in the Winding Staircase. The narrow window overlooks the Bailey.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;jump through window / open window / jump through window / d / x narrow window / open window / climb through window / e / up / down&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We could then add rules to allow the player to look through windows and see things in the rooms below, but that would require more material from later chapters.
