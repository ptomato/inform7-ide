Reading a command</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When reading a command from the keyboard.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Print the prompt text; wait for the player to type something and press return. Reject an entirely blank line, and treat a command beginning &quot;oops&quot; is considered a correction to the previous one. This is a fairly complicated business, so it is probably best not to change the &quot;for&quot; rules for this activity: &quot;before&quot;, and especially &quot;after&quot;, are another matter.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) To lead absolute beginners in gently:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Before reading a command while the turn count is 1, say &quot;(This is your chance to say what the protagonist should do next. After the '>', try typing 'take inventory'.)&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(b) The following responds politely but firmly if the player tries to type &quot;please look&quot;, say, instead of just &quot;look&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode72(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('After reading a command:\n\tif the player\'s command includes "please" begin;\n\t\tsay "Please do not say please.";\n\t\treject the player\'s command;\n\tend if.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode72()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot; begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Please do not say please.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject the player's command;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To explain. Fragments of what the player has typed are called snippets: &quot;the player's command&quot; is the entire thing. We can test if a snippet matches a given pattern like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command matches &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This requires an exact match: the weaker condition &quot;includes&quot; only means that the pattern occurs somewhere in the given snippet, so that
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>matches &quot;please look&quot; or &quot;look please&quot;, etc. Lastly, the phrase
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">reject the player's command
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>tells Inform not to bother analysing the text further, but to go back to the keyboard. (No time passes; no turn elapses; nothing happens in the simulated world.)
<p>
<p>(c) An improved version takes commands like &quot;please drop the coin&quot; and strips &quot;please&quot; from them, but then allows them to proceed normally:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode73(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('After reading a command:\n\tif the player\'s command includes "please" begin;\n\t\tsay "(Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)";\n\t\tcut the matched text;\n\tend if.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode73()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot; begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;(Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut the matched text;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Matched text&quot; is a snippet containing the words which matched against the pattern in the most recent &quot;includes&quot; condition, so in this case it contains just the single word &quot;please&quot;. Two phrases allow snippets to be altered:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">replace (... snippet ...) with (... text ...)
<br>cut (...snippet ...)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(d) To make the word &quot;grab&quot; an abbreviation for &quot;take all&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode74(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('After reading a command:\n\tif the player\'s command matches "grab", replace the player\'s command with "take all".\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode74()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> After reading a command:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player's command matches &quot;grab&quot;, replace the player's command with &quot;take all&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(&quot;Snippet&quot; is actually a kind of value, so we could say &quot;Ah, you typed '[the player's command]'!&quot; or some such if we liked. But in practice only three snippets are likely to be useful: the two mentioned above, &quot;player's command&quot; and &quot;matched text&quot;, and the &quot;topic understood&quot;, used when matching the &quot;[text]&quot; token in command grammar.)

<table border=0 bgcolor="#f0f0f0" width=100%><tr><td><font size=2>
<p>
<p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it's a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.
<p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type >GO WEST CAREFULLY or >CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both. After reading a command is the best point to do this sort of thing, because we can find adverbs, interpret them, and remove them from the command stream. So:

<p>The qualification about turn count is to prevent this before message from occurring when the player first looks around the room (automatically) at the start of play.

<p>Note that to test this example, one must type INSOUCIANTLY TEST ME, and not simply TEST ME: a poseur's work is never done.
