<p>Inform allows us to perform arithmetic on units only where that would make sense, and it keeps track of the results. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">

<p>
<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:
<p>

<p>
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A blackboard propped against one wall reads: &quot;122 / 10 is 12 remainder 2; but 122kg / 10kg is 12 remainder 2kg; and 122kg / 10 is 12kg remainder 2kg.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try.

<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.
<p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.
<p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.
