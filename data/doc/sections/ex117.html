<p>Though realism can become tiresome in interactive fiction, there are times when we cannot go along with Inform's normal assumption that all of a person's possessions are visible to everybody else. People are not like containers, which either show all of their holdings or not, according to whether they are open or transparent. If a man is carrying a fishing rod and a wallet, one will be on open show, the other not. Some clothing is outwardly visible, but not all.
<p>
<p>Whether or not something is concealed is not like the either/or properties we have seen so far - such as being &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; - because it is not really a property of the thing itself, but depends on the habitual behaviour of its current owner. To talk about behaviour we have to use sentences of a kind not seen so far, and which will not fully be explained for some chapters to come.
<p>But straightforward cases are easy to write, if only by imitating the following examples.
<p>
<p>Here we make the Cloaked Villain invariably conceal anything she is holding or wearing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the Cloaked Villain: yes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>At which point we think about it more carefully, and then rewrite:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the Cloaked Villain: if the particular possession is the sable cloak, no; otherwise yes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Parts are treated exactly as if clothes or items being held, and the following will make the face and inscription on a coin invisible unless the player is holding it - the idea being that they are too small to be seen from farther away.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode9(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('The coin is in the Roman Villa. The face and inscription are parts of the coin. Rule for deciding the concealed possessions of the coin: if the coin is carried, no; otherwise yes.\n\n');
