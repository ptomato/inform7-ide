Making reciprocal relations</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>The relationships described in this chapter so far are by no means always reciprocated. For instance, if a stone is on a table, then it is never true that the table is also on the stone. And the question may not even be meaningful to ask. If Peter wears a jacket, the jacket does not even have the possibility of wearing Peter.
<p>
<p>But sometimes we do want a relation which works both ways equally well. These are simple to set up:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Meeting relates people to each other.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The effect is that various people know various other people, and this is always reciprocated. If Daisy knows Sophie then, automatically, Sophie knows Daisy. This even-handedness is maintained throughout play, so that whatever changes are made it is always true that if A knows B then B knows A.
<p>
<p>And similarly for a reciprocal relation between one and another:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In this case, we can again give a name to the partner under a relation:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Marriage relates one person to another (called the spouse).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and now, for instance, we may have that the spouse of John is Yoko and the spouse of Yoko is John.
<p>
<p>Since many of these examples have involved people, it might be worth mentioning again that any kind can be involved, not just the &quot;person&quot; kind.
