<p>
<p>Everything has a kind: but kinds can have more specific kinds. Inform makes the world out of three fundamental kinds of object, &quot;room&quot;, &quot;thing&quot; and &quot;direction&quot;: but, browsing the Kinds index, we find a dozen or so kinds built into Inform. For instance, &quot;container&quot; is a kind of &quot;thing&quot;, and &quot;woman&quot; is a kind of &quot;person&quot; which is in turn a kind of &quot;thing&quot;. The character &quot;Elizabeth&quot; might be a &quot;woman&quot;, and we call this her kind since it is her most specific attribute, even though she is also a &quot;person&quot; and indeed also a &quot;thing&quot;. Everything with physical existence in Inform's model world has a kind.
<p>
<p>Because taxonomy - setting up kinds for everything - is so difficult, and depends so much on what you want it for, Inform creates relatively few kinds in advance: it has &quot;animal&quot; built in, but not &quot;mammal&quot; or &quot;Bengal tiger&quot;. When we need more, we must make them ourselves.
<p>
<p>Any new kind must be created as a special case of an existing one. Here we sub-categorise rooms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Any dead end that we make is also a room, but can also have other properties in addition, if we so decide. Recall that some rooms are &quot;dark&quot;, meaning that there is no light present unless something &quot;lit&quot; is visible.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A dead end is a kind of room with printed name &quot;Dead End&quot; and description &quot;This is a dead end. You'll have to go back the way you came.&quot; A dead end is usually dark.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Undertomb is a dark room. East is a dead end. South is a dead end with printed name &quot;Collapsed Dead End&quot;. Northwest is a dead end called the Tortuous Alcove.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Undertomb is the candle lantern. It is lit.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Three different rooms adjoin the Undertomb as a result. Notice how much more concise this is thanks to having the &quot;dead end&quot; kind to hand.
<p>
<p>For the most part, Inform does not mind in what order it is told about the world, but it may need to know the name of a kind before that kind can be used. For example,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A coffer is a kind of container. In the Crypt is an open coffer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>makes sense to Inform and results in the creation of a new thing, just called &quot;coffer&quot; in the absence of any other name to give it, whose kind is &quot;coffer&quot; and which is initially open. Whereas if Inform reads:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Crypt is an open coffer.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>when it does not know that &quot;coffer&quot; is a kind, it simply makes a thing called &quot;open coffer&quot; and which has no containment properties. Inform has to be careful like this: English is simply too overflowing with multiple meanings. (An &quot;open railway ticket&quot;, for instance, is not a &quot;railway ticket&quot; that one can put objects into.)
<p>
<p>What is a kind, really? In the end it is a name for a bundle of properties, and the key differences between a kind (such as &quot;container&quot;) and a property (such as &quot;fixed in place&quot;) are that, firstly, something only has one kind (except in the sense that a container is also a thing, and so on), and secondly, it has that kind forever, whereas properties may change.
