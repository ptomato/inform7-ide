<p>
<p>&quot;Consider&quot; looks as if it duplicates the effect of &quot;follow&quot;, but in fact it is a simpler business altogether. Unlike &quot;follow&quot;, it doesn't get side-tracked into consulting the procedural rules, with all of the resultant change which might result from that. This is a finicky but important distinction. A great many rules and rulebooks make use of each other when actions are being processed, but we only want the procedural rules to be looked at once, right at the start.
<p>
<p>A general guideline here is that if rule A needs to use rule B, and both are engaged in the same basic activity - for instance both are basically processing actions - then A should use &quot;consider B&quot;. Only if B is something entirely unrelated should A use &quot;follow B&quot;. Thus:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...is a case where rule A, the one about processing the &quot;switch on the machine&quot; action, is engaged in a completely different activity to rule B, which is all about telling the player what a wonderful amount of progress has been made so far. &quot;Follow&quot; is therefore appropriate.

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:

<p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test suite that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.
