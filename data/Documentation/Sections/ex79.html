<p>
<p>The passage of time in interactive fiction is broken up into a succession of turns, in each of which the player types a request and is given a response. Usually each such request triggers one action, but sometimes a whole sequence are fired off, as when the player types &quot;get all&quot; in a cluttered room.
<p>
<p>One of the last things to happen in each turn is that Inform will apply any rules which have been set to occur &quot;every turn&quot;, like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is equivalent to writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">An every turn rule: say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that the text about blossom, which will quickly become tiresome, is said at the end of every turn, not at the beginning, and in particular not before the player's first opportunity to type a command.
<p>
<p>As usual when defining rules, we can add stipulations: any condition can be attached using &quot;when&quot;.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when in the Orchard, say &quot;The summer breeze shakes the apple-blossom.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn when the player can see the rotting fish, say &quot;Your nose twitches involuntarily.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>

<p>The following example makes fairly ample use of material that we haven't seen yet, but gives some idea of the flexibility of every turn rules. Suppose we want to have a number of electrical devices, all of which may be powered by a set of batteries. The batteries will all need to be discharged as they are used (regardless of what device they happen to be controlling at the moment). So:
