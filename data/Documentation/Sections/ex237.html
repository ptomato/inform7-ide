<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> When an action which requires light is tried, and the visibility rules decide that not enough light is present.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> To print &quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing a refusal to act in the dark: if we are examining something, say &quot;It's not totally dark here, perhaps, but certainly too dim for close-up examination of anything.&quot; instead.
