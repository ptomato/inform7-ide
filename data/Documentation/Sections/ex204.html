<p>
<p>A condition is a yes/no decision, but we can also take decisions where the result is a value. Suppose we want to create a concept of the &quot;grand prize&quot;, which will have different values at different times in play. Each time the &quot;grand prize&quot; is referred to, Inform will have to decide what its value is, and the following tells Inform how to make that decision:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide which treasure is the grand prize:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Dark Room has been visited then decide on the silver bars;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide on the plover's egg.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Note that we have to say what kind the answer will be: here it's a kind of thing called &quot;treasure&quot; (which we're supposing has already been created), and as it turns out only two treasures are ever eligible anyway (we're also supposing that the plover's egg and the silver bars are treasures already created, of course). And note also that the phrase must in all cases end with a &quot;decide on ...&quot; to say what the answer is.
<p>
<p>Now that we have &quot;grand prize&quot; created, we can use it just as we would use any other value, so for instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if taking the grand prize then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write something like:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what number is the target score: ...
</font></blockquote><p>

Understand "window" as ticket windows.\n\nThe mural is fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. "At the north side of the station is a particularly pointless and empty annex to the main room. It is dominated by a huge relief of sorts, and this is what you remember." Understand "metal" or "relief" or "huge" as the mural. The description of the mural is "It is both stylized and confusing, but you think it might be supposed to represent the various tasks and occupations of Philadelphia\'s population. The portions closer to the ground look as though they have recently been subjected to a light dusting of talcum powder. No unusual prints are evident."\n\nThe wind chimes are fixed in place in Thirtieth Street. "Carefully attached to the wall with a piece of duct tape and a hook is a light-weight set of wind chimes. Someone else has been here before you, it seems." The description is "Several of your friends use wind chimes as a sort of ghost alarm, since ghosts sometimes cause very localized movements of air when there is no natural breeze."\n\nA ghost is a kind of person. The pale figure is a ghost.\n\nAt 9:03 AM: move the pale figure to the location; say "You shiver with some sort of presence."\n\nTest me with "turn on alarm / turn on meter / z / z / z / x figure".\n');
