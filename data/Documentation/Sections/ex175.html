<p>
<p><b>1. When it happens.</b> Whenever the name of a thing or room is printed.
<p>
<p><b>2. The default behaviour.</b> Its &quot;printed name&quot; property is printed out.
<p>
<p><b>3. Examples.</b> (a) A pen which is described differently in inventories:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for printing the name of the pen while taking inventory: say &quot;useful pen&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>&quot;Taking inventory&quot; is a condition which is true if that's the current action and not otherwise, so the effect is that the pen is called &quot;a useful pen&quot; only in inventory listings. &quot;While looking&quot; is a similarly useful one.
<p>
<p>(b) Italicising the names of novels:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A novel is a kind of thing. Dr Zhivago and Persuasion are novels. Before printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[italic type]&quot;. After printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(c) Telling the time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After printing the name of the wrist watch while taking inventory: say &quot; (time: [the time of day])&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(d) Merging containers with their contents:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode58(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:\n\tif the bottle contains sand, say "bottle of sand";\n\totherwise say "empty bottle";\n\tomit contents in listing.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode58()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the bottle contains sand, say &quot;bottle of sand&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;omit contents in listing.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The special phrase &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; means that any inventory list, room description, etc., will simply list &quot;a bottle of sand&quot; or &quot;an empty bottle&quot;, rather than &quot;a bottle (in which is sand)&quot; or &quot;a bottle (which is empty)&quot;. The clause about not inserting or removing is to prevent messages like &quot;You put the sand in the bottle of sand.&quot;, where it's confusing to refer to the bottle as anything other than &quot;the bottle&quot;.

No, probably not. Well... At any rate, I need the [generator]. Oh, don\'t worry, they\'re expensive but not so expensive that I won\'t be able to save up for another, in a few months".\n\nThe gift is a subject. The description is "[The mental wave generator] was a present from a girl named [Shari]. Actually I\'m not sure she\'d take to being called a girl".\n\nShari is a subject. The description is "Look, let\'s just not go into it, okay? I don\'t really want to relive all that right now.

You stare dubiously at the awkward crystal sculpture in your hands.";\n\tnow Nathan knows every subject.\n\nInstead of asking Nathan about something while the player carries the sculpture, say "[Nathan] moans dramatically and refuses to be drawn into conversation."\n\nThe player is carrying an awkward crystal sculpture.
