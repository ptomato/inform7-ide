<p>
<p>A sentence consists of two nouns with a verb between them. Usually, the two nouns are descriptions, as in:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Collins is in a lighted room.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;Mr Collins&quot; and &quot;a lighted room&quot; are descriptions, the full rules for which were given in Chapter 5. But there are sentences where one or both of the nouns is a value instead. For instance, in
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if the score is greater than 10, ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>the sentence &quot;the score is greater than 10&quot; consists of two values (&quot;the score&quot; and &quot;10&quot;) connected by a verb part (&quot;is greater than&quot;).
<p>
<p>This chapter is about getting the most out of sentences by defining new verbs to express ideas not already built in to Inform. Before we can define a new sentence verb, however, we must first look at the meanings of verbs: which Inform calls &quot;relations&quot;.

<p>
<p>An entire grammar for the whole mass of Inform would not be linguistically interesting: it contains many convenient wordings which are not really part of a grand pattern. Inform does, however, have a formal notion of a Sentence, a grammatical structure which we shall call S. It is almost true that conditions (&quot;if the flowerpot is on the wall&quot;) have the same grammar as assertions (&quot;The flowerpot is on the wall&quot;) and &quot;now&quot; phrases (&quot;now the flowerpot is on the wall&quot;). All three use the S grammar, so we could define an assertion as &quot;S.&quot;, say that &quot;if S&quot;, &quot;while S&quot;, &quot;when S&quot; and so on are conditions, and say that &quot;now S&quot; defines the &quot;now&quot; declaration.
<p>
<p>Grammatical sentences do not necessarily make sense, of course. Many perfectly grammatical assertions in fact give rise to problem messages:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wicker basket is not in the kitchen. (<i>Unhelpfully negative.</i>)
<br>The wicker basket has been in the kitchen. (<i>Talks about a time which never existed.</i>)
<br>The wicker basket is full. (<i>Full of what? Too vague.</i>)
<br>The wicker basket is the ginger cat. (<i>Demonstrably false.</i>)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Whereas the first three, at least, would be sensible as conditions. So saying that assertions are &quot;just like&quot; conditions is a little misleading: what they have in common is S, the underlying grammar they each use as a starting-point.
<p>
<p>To define S, we break it up into subsidiary structures. The most important is the Description Phrase (DP), examples of which include &quot;the red basket&quot;, &quot;somewhere lighted&quot; and &quot;an empty open container&quot;. This we will take as read, since the account given at the start of Chapter 5 is quite explicit. Clearly sentences include DPs, but they also include other ingredients. The general pattern used in Inform is very simple:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1. S = DP + VP
<br>2. VP = Verb + DP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>where VP is another structure, the Verb Phrase. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">S (The horseman wears a riding helmet)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= DP (The horseman) + VP (wears a riding helmet)
<br>VP (wears a riding helmet)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Verb (wears) + DP (a riding helmet)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In that example, the Verb was the single word &quot;wears&quot;. More generally, Inform allows a Verb to include adverbs and prepositions, to be negated, and to come in any of four tenses, so the following are all valid examples of Verb in our grammar:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">wore
<br>carries
<br>is carried by
<br>had not been inside
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Although we are not going through the definition of Description Phrases in detail, it is worth noticing how &quot;which&quot; and &quot;who&quot; behave:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">3a. DP = DP + which + VP
<br>3b. DP = DP + who + VP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus &quot;an open container which is in the Ballroom&quot; can be broken down as:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">DP (an open container) + which + VP (is in the Ballroom)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>To understand compounds like &quot;something in a container&quot;, we have to invent a new grammatical structure for &quot;in a container&quot; and similar: let's call this a Relative Phrase (RP).
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">4. DP = DP + RP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Thus &quot;an open container in the Ballroom&quot; is DP (an open container) + RP (in the Ballroom). Relative Phrases have two different forms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">5a. RP = Preposition + DP
<br>5b. RP = Participle + DP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>so that &quot;in a container&quot; is an example of 5a. An example of 5b would be
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">RP (worn by Mr Darcy) = Participle (worn by) + DP (Mr Darcy)
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That is nearly it, but not quite: we must go back to the &quot;almost&quot; in the statement above that assertions and conditions &quot;almost&quot; have the same grammar S. The difference arises from a curious irregularity in English called subject-verb inversion (see the <i>Oxford English Grammar</i> at 3.22F), whereby assertions can be reversed but not conditions. For instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Garden is a sunflower.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This does not follow the pattern S = DP + VP, because &quot;in the garden&quot; is not a DP: indeed, it is not a noun at all. To make sense of this sentence, Inform reverses it to &quot;A sunflower is in the Garden&quot;, which does indeed follow DP + VP. Hence the final rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">6 (assertions only). S = RP + Verb + DP
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So the condition &quot;if in the garden is a sunflower...&quot; fails because rule 6 does not apply to the grammar for conditions: while occasional poetic uses of subject-verb inversion do turn up in conditions (&quot;If On A Winter's Night A Traveller&quot;, say), they are rare in ordinary English usage, and illegal in Inform. That completes the S grammar, so to recap:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">1. S = DP + VP
<br>2. VP = Verb + DP
<br>3a. DP = DP + which + VP
<br>3b. DP = DP + who + VP
<br>4. DP = DP + RP
<br>5a. RP = Preposition + DP
<br>5b. RP = Participle + DP
<br>6 (assertions only). S = RP + Verb + DP
</font></blockquote><p>
