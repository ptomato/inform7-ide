<p>
<p>Rooms represent individual places to which one can go, but we tend to think of the world around us in larger pieces: we think of a house and a garden, rather than each of the single rooms of the house and all corners of its garden. To Inform a collection of rooms is called a &quot;region&quot;, and we can create one like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Arboretum is east of the Botanical Gardens. Northwest of the Gardens is the Tropical Greenhouse.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Public Area is a region. The Arboretum and Gardens are in the Public Area.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The real usefulness of creating regions like &quot;Public Area&quot; will only appear later, when we begin defining rules of play which apply in some areas but not others, but in the mean time we can see the effect by turning to the World tab of the Index. In the World Index, Inform draws a map - or at least a stylised attempt at a diagram of the rooms and their connections: this will not always correspond to how we imagine things, but with any luck it should mostly be right.
<p>
<p>Rooms are represented by coloured squares, and the colour-coding is done by region. In the above example, the two &quot;Public Area&quot; rooms are coloured green (as it happens); the Greenhouse, since it belongs to no region, is a neutral grey.
<p>
<p>Regions can be put inside each other:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The University Parks is a region. The Public Area is in the University Parks.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>but they are not allowed to overlap other than by one being entirely inside the other.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Queen Street at the Prison is east of Queen Street East.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, if we like, we can create regions to distinguish the coast from the portions of town that aren't on the water:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Inland is a region. Queen Street End, Queen Street Middle, Queen Street East, Private Alley, Lime Street, and Queen Street at the Prison are in Inland.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Waterfront is a region. Thames Street before Fort Carlisle, Thames Street by the King's House, Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge, Water Lane, Fishmarket, Fisher's Row, and Thames Street End are in Waterfront.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>There's no rule that regions must be contiguous, so we could if we like make a region consisting just of the two forts:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Military Holdings is a region. Fort Carlisle and Fort James are in Military Holdings.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And we might make the Feathers Tavern part of the Inland area, but within its own subcategory:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Tavern is a region. It is in Inland. Feathers and Feathers Bedroom are in Tavern.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now the index map will be colored to reflect our regions, and later in the game development we would be able to make rules that affect just one region at a time.
