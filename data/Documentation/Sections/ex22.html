Rooms and the map</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Rooms are joined together at their edges by &quot;map connections&quot;, most of which are pathways in one of the eight cardinal compass directions: north, northeast (written without a hyphen), east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest. We also have up and down, suitable for staircases or ladders. In real life, people are seldom conscious of their compass bearing when walking around buildings, but it makes a concise and unconfusing way for the player to say where to go next, so is generally accepted as a convention of the genre.
<p>
<p>Two more directions are provided by Inform: &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot;. These are best used when one location is, say, a meadow and the other is a woodcutter's hut in the middle of it; we might then say
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Inside from the Meadow is the woodcutter's hut.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The &quot;from&quot; is important, as it clarifies that we intend to link two different locations, not to create an item - the hut - in a single location - the meadow.
<p>
<p>A problem which sometimes arises when laying out maps is that Inform allows short forms of room names to be used as abbreviations. This is usually a good idea, but has unfortunate results if we write:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Airport Road is west of the Fish Packing Plant. The Airport is west of the Airport Road.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...because &quot;Airport&quot; is taken as a reference to &quot;Airport Road&quot;, so Inform makes only two locations, one of which supernaturally leads to itself. We can avoid this by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Airport Road is west of the Fish Packing Plant. A room called the Airport is west of the Airport Road.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Using &quot;called&quot; is often a good way to specify something whose name might give rise to confusion otherwise. It always makes something new, and it is also neatly concise, because we can establish something's kind and name in the same sentence. As another example, suppose we want to create a room called &quot;South of the Hut&quot;, to south of the Hut. We can't do so like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">South of the Hut is a room. South of the Hut is south of the Hut.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>...because Inform will read that first sentence as placing a (nameless) room to the south of a room called &quot;Hut&quot;. Once again &quot;called&quot; can save the day:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">South of the Hut is a room called South of the Hut.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is best to use &quot;called&quot; in the simplest way possible, and in particular, best not to use &quot;called&quot; twice in the same sentence. Consider:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The kitchen cabinet contains a container called a mixing bowl and a portable supporter called a platter.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>It is unlikely that anyone would want to name something &quot;a mixing bowl and a portable supporter called a platter&quot;, but not impossible, and Inform tends not to be a good judge of what is likely.

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">&quot;1691&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fort James is a room. &quot;The enclosure of Fort James is a large, roughly hexagonal court walled with heavy stone.  The walls face the entrance to Port Royal Harbour, and the battery of guns is prepared to destroy any enemy ship arriving.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Unless we arrange otherwise, this will be the first room in the game because it is the first we have defined.
<p>
<p>For subsequent rooms, we do not have to say explicitly that they are rooms, as long as they are connected to a room on the map. For instance, this will automatically make Thames Street End a room:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thames Street End is south of Fort James. &quot;The ill-named Thames Street runs from here -- at the point of the peninsula -- all the way east among houses and shops, through the Fish Market, edging by the round front of Fort Carlisle, to the point where the town stops and there is only sandy spit beyond.  Most of that stretch is full of people at all hours.  Imported goods are moved off of ships and taken to distributors; exported goods are brought to be loaded; and there is one public house and brothel for every ten inhabitants.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lime Street, wider and healthier but not as rich, runs directly south, and to the north the road opens up into the courtyard of Fort James.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Water Lane is east of Thames Street End. &quot;Here Thames Street -- never very straight -- goes steeply southeast for a portion before continuing more directly to the east.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Water Lane runs south toward Queen Street, and facing onto it is the New Prison -- which, in the way of these things, is neither.  It did serve in that capacity for a time, and in a measure of the villainy which has been usual in Port Royal from its earliest days, it is nearly the largest building in the town.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we have some concern that the room name will be confused with an existing name, we can be more explicit about it using &quot;called&quot;:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">East of Water Lane is a room called Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge.  Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge has the description &quot;To the southwest is the fishmarket; directly across the street is the entrance to a private alley through a brick archway.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Fishmarket is southwest of Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Private Alley is south of Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge. &quot;You're just outside the tavern the Feathers. To the north, under a pretty little archway, is the active mayhem of Thames Street, but the alley narrows down to a dead end a little distance to the south.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now we get &quot;inside&quot;, which generates a space treated as its own area on the map.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Feathers is inside from the Private Alley.  &quot;Newly built with brick, replacing the older Feathers tavern that used to stand here. It sells wines in quantity, as well as serving them directly, and the goods are always of the best quality. There's a room upstairs for those wanting to stay the night.&quot; The Feathers Bedroom is above the Feathers.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thames Street by the King's House is east of Thames Street at the Wherry Bridge.  &quot;The King's House is reserved for the use of the Governor, but he does not live in it, and it is frequently being rented out to some merchant so that the government will at least derive some value from it. It is nearly the least interesting establishment on Thames Street, and the crowd -- which, to the west, is extremely dense -- here thins out a bit.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Thames Street before Fort Carlisle is east of Thames Street by the King's House. &quot;Here Thames Street, formerly a respectable width, narrows to a footpath in order to edge around the front of Fort Carlisle, underneath the mouths of the cannon.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">There are no buildings on the harbour side of Thames Street at this point, which means that you have an unusually good view of the ships at dock, water beyond, and the Blue Mountains rising on the other side of the harbour.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can also invert the order in which we declare things, like this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">South of Thames Street before Fort Carlisle is a room called Fort Carlisle. The description of Fort Carlisle is &quot;Handsomely arrayed with cannons which you could fire at any moment -- though of course there are ships at dock which might be in the way.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And if we like we can declare a number of rooms for which we will come back and write the descriptions later. There is no obligation for the description to occur at the first definition of the room.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Lime Street is south of Thames Street End.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Queen Street End is south of Lime Street.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Queen Street Middle is east of Queen Street End.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For efficiency, we can also write multiple sets of connections at once:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Queen Street East is east of Queen Street Middle and south of Private Alley.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Queen Street at the Prison is east of Queen Street East.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Clicking Go will translate this description into a sketchy but working simulation of Port Royal, in which we can type movement commands like EAST or SOUTH to explore the streets. Looking at the World tab of the Index, we can also see a schematic map of the simulation as it currently stands. Like the rest of the Index, this is provided entirely for the author's benefit, and is not visible to the player. (Though if we do decide that we want players to have access to a printed map while they play, Inform can help: we will return to the layout of Port Royal in the chapter on Publishing.)
<p>
<p>The following Test command allows us to type TEST ME and explore the map we just devised:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;s / e / e / e / e / s / n / w / w / s / in / up / down / out / s / e / w / w / w / n / n / e / e / sw&quot;.
