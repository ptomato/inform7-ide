<p>
<p>Short of something like a power cut, the game can only end when one of the two participants chooses to end it: either the player, by deciding that enough is enough, or us.
<p>
<p>If we decide that a conclusion of some kind, happy or not, has been reached, we can herald that moment with phrases like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">end the game in death
<br>end the game in victory
<br>end the game saying &quot;You have come to a full stop&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The phrase &quot;end the game in death&quot; is equivalent to ending it saying &quot;You have died&quot;, and similarly victory simply means announcing &quot;You have won&quot;. (Note that the actual ending does not follow instantly, but rather, at the next available opportunity, which usually means when the current rule has finished.)
<p>
<p>The more general phrase allows any text (short, please) to be used:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of eating the fish, end the game saying &quot;You have been poisoned&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The rulebook &quot;when play ends&quot; is the matching bookend to &quot;when play begins&quot;. It is followed when the game decides to end (not when the player simply gives up and quits), and before any epitaph like
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">*** You have been poisoned ***
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>appears. For example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play ends, say &quot;Oh dear.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In such a rule, the phrase &quot;resume the game&quot; will cause play to continue exactly as if no ending had been reached at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When play ends when the game ended in death:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Oh dear. Still, here's another chance.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resume the game.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The conditions &quot;the game ended in death&quot; and &quot;the game ended in victory&quot; can be used by &quot;When play ends&quot; rules to distinguish the outcome, if it matters.

<p>Some older games allowed the player to be resurrected after a death, but punished him by distributing his possessions far and wide. Here we emulate that effect.
