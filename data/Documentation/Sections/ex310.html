<p>Finally, there is a kind of relation which binds even more strongly.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Nationality relates people to each other in groups.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is a kind of relation which divides people up: we might wish to have all the Icelandic people related to each other, all the Peruvians to each other, and so on. If there were a Pacific island called Informia with one inhabitant, then that person would be related only to himself. As time goes by, we could imagine people emigrating, and so on, so that these groupings would switch: perhaps everyone would leave Belgium and, for a while, there would be no Belgian nationals at all.

<p>The range of things one might want to do with a rope in a work of interactive fiction is fairly overwhelming. One might, in theory, swing from ropes; use them to tie containers shut; cut them up into smaller ropes; tie them together into longer ropes; employ them as fuses; bind other characters with them, or the player character.
<p>
<p>Our rope implementation is, by these lights, reasonably simple, but it does account for the possibility of tying and untying both ends; using ropes to descend into lower rooms; pulling objects tied to the far end of the rope; and dragging objects from place to place.

"The very land is gloomy, the earth plowed into untended rows that yield no fruit, shadowed by the castle to the north. A chasm, no doubt the product of some upheaval of the earth, opens before your feet.". An oak stump is fixed in place in the Field. "From an oak stump, a few hopeful shoots grow." A hempen rope is a rope in the field. It is stuck to the oak stump and the wooden chest. The stump is unevenly shaped.\n\nThe Chasm is below the Field. "Your person is most uncomfortably pressed on every side by the closeness of the walls; to which you may add as a further inconvenience, that the irregularity of the floor making it difficult to walk upright." An iron key is in the Chasm. "An iron key nestles in the cleft of earth, its age indicated by its implausibly great size."\n\nThe wooden chest is a unevenly shaped closed openable container in the Chasm. The description of the wooden chest is "A handsome, solid case not long committed to its dank enclosure, or it would long since have rotted." Rule for printing the name of the wooden chest when the chest is not handled: say "deadweight". Understand "dead" or "weight" or "deadweight" as the chest. Before pulling the wooden chest: now the chest is handled.\n\nIn the chest is a heavy dagger. The description of the dagger is "Set with red jewels and of a wicked aspect."\n\nBefore going down from the Field when the player is not stuck to something anchored:\n\tsay "You don\'t quite dare simply leap into the darkness without some anchor." instead.\n\nBefore going down from the Field:\n\tlet anchor be a random anchored thing which is stuck to the player;\n\tsay "You lower yourself gingerly, hoping that [the anchor] holds your weight..."\n\nBefore going up from the Chasm:\n\tif the player cannot touch a rope which is stuck to an anchored thing which is in the Field, say "And how, precisely, do you mean to do that?" instead.\n\nThe Castle Hall is north of the Field. "All is desolate: the great hall has no roof, nor is there any glass in the windows. A staircase without banister ascends inside the wall to a musician\'s gallery without song."\n\nThe Musician\'s Gallery is above the Castle Hall. "Of its former cheery aspect only this remains to the Gallery: that chevrons of red and yellow are painted on the wall. But as these are streaked with rain and grime, the banister pulled away, the roof open to the sky, and the corners made a nesting place for birds, the consolation thereby afforded is but slight."\n\nThe pointed door is north of the Musician\'s Gallery and south of the Sinister Attic. It is a closed locked openable door. "A pointed door of particularly grim and uninviting aspect leads north." The pointed door is lockable and unevenly shaped. The description of the pointed door is "A door coming to a gothic point and fitted with iron fittings of great strength. The handle looks particularly well-attached." The iron key unlocks the pointed door.\n\nInstead of opening the pointed door for the first time:\n\tsay "When you rattle at the door, there arises from beyond a terrible shrill noise as though something beyond exults in its imminent release."\n\nAfter opening the trapped pointed door when the player can see the pointed door:\n\tsay "Thousands of bats fly from the pointed door, attacking you!";\n\tend the game in death.\n\nAfter opening the pointed door when the player cannot see the pointed door: now the pointed door is untrapped; continue the action.\n\nThe pointed door can be trapped or untrapped. The pointed door is trapped.\n\nBefore pulling the pointed door: try opening the pointed door instead.\n\nThe player is unevenly shaped.\n\nAfter going to the sinister attic:\n\tsay "You have arrived at the goal of your quest!";\n\tend the game in victory.\n\nTest me with "x rope / pull rope / get chest / untie rope from chest / tie rope to me / down / get key / up / untie rope from stump / north / up / unlock pointed door with key / open it / tie rope to door / down / pull rope / up / north".\n\nTest death with "x rope / pull rope / get chest / untie rope from chest / tie rope to me / down / get key / up / untie rope from stump / north / up / unlock pointed door with key / open it / g"\n\n');
