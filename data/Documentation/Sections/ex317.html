Defining new assertion verbs</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Here is an example definition of a new verb:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The verb to sport (he sports, they sport, he sported, it is sported, he is sporting) implies the wearing relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Once this is done, we can write the assertion
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Wickham sports a Tory rosette.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which will do the the same thing as
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Mr Wickham wears a Tory rosette.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>because both verbs have the same relation as their meaning.
<p>
<p>Note that we have to spell out many parts of the verb:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">to sport - infinitive
<br>he sports - present singular
<br>they sport - present plural
<br>he sported - past
<br>it is sported - past participle
<br>he is sporting - present participle
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Although it looks as if Inform could easily generate these given the infinitive &quot;to sport&quot; alone, by adding an &quot;-s&quot; here or an &quot;-ed&quot; there, English can be a very irregular language. Since only a few verbs will be defined in any single project it seems best to be explicit. (If we do miss out any of the parts of the verb, the result will be that the usages missed out will not be understood by Inform. Sometimes that's a good thing, as some verbs have seldom-used present participles, for instance - &quot;he is liking me&quot;, for instance, is grammatical but odd.)
<p>
<p>The Phrasebook index contains all the verbs associated with assertions, in the &quot;table of verbs&quot; section. When we add new verbs to our source, those will appear in the Phrasebook as well.

<p>
<p>Hint systems in IF come in a variety of flavors: some are a static, prewritten set of guidelines (which might exist in a menu or outside the game entirely); others are built in as part of the program, and attempt to adapt to the situation the player currently faces. Adaptive hints have the advantage that they are less likely to reveal information for which the player is not ready, and the disadvantage that they are more work for the author.
<p>
<p>The exercise here is to write an adaptive hint system that will both respond in agile ways to the state of the world model and require a minimum of authorial fussing. We also want the player to be able to ask for a hint about any object he encounters in the game world: this will let him be specific and avoid accidentally receiving hints about the wrong puzzles.
<p>
<p>Our baseline assumption is that a player may find a puzzle unsolvable for one of two reasons: he either hasn't seen the relevant clue, or he hasn't got the relevant equipment. If these are true, then he should be given hints about how to find this information, and then once he has it, more specific hints about the puzzle itself -- ending, as a last resort, with the exact command(s) he will need to use in order to bring about the solution.
<p>
<p>In practice, there are other possibilities, but this will do for an example.
<p>
<p>We begin by defining our relations:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode284(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"The Unexamined Life"\n\nExplaining relates one thing to various things. The verb to explain (it explains, they explain, it explained, it is explained, it is explaining) implies the explaining relation.\n\nInstead of hinting about something when something unexamined (called the clue) explains the noun:\n\tsay "You\'re still missing some information that might be useful to understanding the problem. [More]";\n\tif player consents, try hinting about the clue.\n\nRequiring relates one thing to various things. The verb to require (it requires, they require, it required, it is required, it is requiring) implies the requiring relation.\n\nInstead of hinting about something when the noun requires something (called the implement) which is not carried by the player:\n\tsay "You\'re missing an object that might be useful to resolving this problem. [More]";\n\tif player consents, try hinting about the implement.\n\nHinting about is an action applying to one visible thing. Understand "hint about [any thing]" as hinting about.\n\n[This allows us to create the most absolutely generic sort of hint -- boring, perhaps, but in practice the player often just needs a nudge about what part of the game world he should be examining for a solution:]\n\nCarry out hinting about:\n\tif something explains the noun, say "You might want to review [the list of things which explain the noun]. ";\n\tif the noun requires something\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "You should be sure that you have [the list of things required by the noun]. ";\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay "Sorry, I can\'t advise you further on that.";\n\tend if.\n\n[These things cover hinting about objects that are themselves puzzles. But what if the player asks for hints about a tool or piece of information because he doesn\'t know how to apply it yet? We might want to give some guidance there, as well.]\n\nCarry out hinting about something which explains something (called target):\n\tif target is unseen, say "[The noun] might prove useful information, sooner or later." instead;\n\totherwise say "You could examine [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about something which is required by something:\n\tsay "[The noun] might be useful to have. [More]";\n\tif player consents\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif a seen thing requires the noun, say "[The noun] may help with [the list of seen things which require the noun]." instead;\n\t\totherwise say "There are [number of things which require the noun in words] problems for which [the noun] might come in handy." instead;\n\tend if.\n\n[Now we have these general hints written, but we want to pre-empt them if the player has not yet fulfilled all the prerequisites.]\n\nInstead of hinting about something unseen:\n\tif the noun is visible\n\tbegin;\n\t\tnow the noun is seen;\n\t\tcontinue the action;\n\tend if;\n\tsay "Perhaps you should explore further. ";\n\tif the ultimate location of the noun is an unvisited room\n\tbegin;\n\t\ttry hinting about the ultimate location of the noun;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tif the ultimate location of the noun is the location\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tsay "You\'re in the correct room right now[if the visible shell of the noun is a thing]. Try further exploring [the visible shell of the noun][end if].";\n\t\totherwise;\n\t\t\ttry hinting about the ultimate location of the noun;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend if.\n\nInstead of hinting about a visited room:\n\tsay "There\'s a room you\'ve visited, but you haven\'t exhausted all there is to see there. [More]";\n\tif player consents\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "Try going back to [the noun]. [More]";\n\t\tif player consents, direct player to the noun;\n\tend if.\n\nInstead of hinting about an unvisited room:\n\tsay "There\'s a room you haven\'t yet visited.  [More]";\n\tif player consents, direct player to the noun.\n\nTo direct player to (goal - a room):\n\tlet way be the best route from location to the goal, using even locked doors;\n\tif way is a direction, say "Try going [way] to start your explorations.";\n\totherwise say "Sorry, the route is an indirect one.";\n\nInstead of hinting about a portable seen thing which is not visible:\n\tif the noun is scenery, continue the action;\n\tsay "You have seen the item you need to solve this problem, but it\'s not in sight at the moment.  [More]";\n\tif player consents\n\tbegin;\n\t\ttry hinting about the ultimate location of the noun;\n\tend if.\n\n[And this business of "seen" things requires, of course, that we keep track:]\n\nA thing can be seen or unseen. A thing is usually unseen. The player is seen. After printing the name of something (called target): now the target is seen.\n\n[That "After printing..." rule means that as soon as the game automatically prints the name of an object, it tags that object as having been "seen" by the player. This requires just a little care on our part, that we never mention an object without using the game\'s printing rules. Still, it is much easier than most other possible forms of bookkeeping.]\n\n[We also need to deal with the question of whether the player has examined an object, for those objects whose descriptions carry vital information:]\n\nA thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.\n\n[In practice, there might be other ways of getting vital facts, and in a more sophisticated puzzle game we might need a more sophisticated model to track this. But examined or unexamined will do for now.]\n\nTo decide what room is the ultimate location of (item - a thing):\n\tlet place be the holder of the item;\n\twhile the place is a thing, let the place be the holder of the place;\n\tif the place is a room, decide on the place.\n\nTo decide what thing is the visible shell of (item - a thing):\n\tif item is visible, decide on the item;\n\tlet place be the holder of the item;\n\twhile place is a thing and place is not visible, let place be the holder of the place;\n\tif the place is visible, decide on the place.\n\nTo say more:\n\tsay "[paragraph break]Shall I go on? > ";\n\n[That covers most of the generic hints, but let\'s also add some slightly more precise hints about a few kinds of objects that are especially important in the model world. These hints will probably not be very interesting to a seasoned IF veteran, but a novice player who does not know the wording or cannot guess what something might be for may still find them useful:]\n\nCarry out hinting about a locked lockable thing:\n\tsay "You could unlock [the noun] with [the matching key of the noun]." instead.\n\nInstead of hinting about a locked thing when the matching key of the noun is not carried by the player:\n\tif the player can see the matching key of the noun\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "Perhaps [the matching key of the noun] would help.";\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay "[The noun] is locked. There must be a key around somewhere. [More]";\n\t\tif player consents, try hinting about the matching key of the noun;\n\tend if.\n\nCarry out hinting about a closed openable unlocked thing:\n\tsay "You could open [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about an open door:\n\tsay "You could enter [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about an unexamined thing:\n\tsay "You might find out something if you examine [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about an edible thing:\n\tsay "You could eat [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about a wearable thing:\n\tsay "You could wear [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out hinting about a pushable between rooms thing:\n\tsay "You could push [the noun] some direction." instead.\n\n[Now to the actual objects in the game:]\n\nThe Crypt is a room. "This squat, barrel-vaulted chamber runs roughly north-south. Along either side are the graves of Saxon kings and early bishops of the church long since gone to dust -- one [tomb] in particular looks undisturbed."\n\n[Notice that we used the bracketed tomb here: the tomb is scenery, and if we do not use the name-printing function, Inform will not register that we have mentioned it to the player.]\n\nThe tomb is scenery in the Crypt. The tomb is openable and closed. The silver dagger is a thing in the tomb. Understand "tombs" as the tomb. The description of the silver dagger is "Gleaming in a soft light all its own. Its blade is figured with running deer and its hilt is made of horn." The wight requires the silver dagger. The tomb require the pry bar.\n\nInstead of opening the tomb when the player does not carry the pry bar:\n\tsay "The lids are stone, too heavy for you to raise without some implement."\n\n[Now we can add specific hints to replace the generic ones:]\n\nCarry out hinting about the tomb:\n\tsay "The lids are heavy, but you can open them when you carry the pry bar."\n\n[The rest of the hint system ensures that the player will not see this final suggestion until he has the pry bar, since the tomb "requires" the pry bar. Having the hint there doesn\'t excuse us from providing some alternate wording in case the player solves this not-very-difficult conundrum on his own, though:]\n\nUnderstand "pry [something] with [something preferably held]" as unlocking it with. Understand the commands "lever" or "prise" as "pry".\n\nInstead of unlocking something with the pry bar, try opening the noun.\n\nThe wight is a man in the Crypt. "[The wight] lurks near the south exit." The description of wight is "Old English [italic type]wiht[roman type]: a thing, a creature. It is little more than the memory of a life ill-lived, but it lingers here." Understand "wiht" or "creature" or "ghost" as the wight.\n\nInstead of going south in the presence of wight:\n\tsay "The wight breathes chill into your face.\n\nYour head swims, and you are aware that you no longer have the willpower to go in that direction."\n\nFresh Air is south from the Crypt.\n\nAfter going to Fresh Air:\n\taward 1 point;\n\tsay "Congratulations, you have escaped!";\n\tend the game in victory.\n\nThe inscription is fixed in place in the Crypt. "Someone has painstakingly carved [an inscription] into the wall above the door." The description is "Squinting, you decipher the Latin text: [italic type]Silver causes harm to those that live though dead[roman type]." The inscription explains wight.\n\nThe Treasure Chamber is north of the Crypt. "The walls are thick, the high windows promisingly barred with iron. But for all this there is no hint of any valuable stores remaining."\n\nThe pry bar is in the Treasure Chamber. "One of the window bars, rusted from its place, lies in a puddle of water." Understand "window" or "bars" as the pry bar. The description of the pry bar is "A few feet long, and not entirely rusted into uselessness yet."\n\nInstead of giving the dagger to wight:\n\tsay "The wight recoils, appalled."\n\nCarry out hinting about wight:\n\tsay "You will have to find some way to get wight to come in physical contact with the silver dagger, which he will certainly not do willingly. [More]";\n\tif player consents, say "You could, for instance, throw it at him." instead;\n\totherwise stop the action.\n\nUnderstand "touch [something] with [something]" as putting it on (with nouns reversed). Understand "hit [someone] with [something]" as putting it on (with nouns reversed).\n\nInstead of attacking the wight:\n\tsay "You can\'t force yourself to approach close enough for hand to hand combat: if, indeed, the wight has hands."\n\nInstead of putting the dagger on wight:\n\tsay "The wight fades out of your way without ever coming into contact with the dagger. Perhaps a more projectile method would work better."\n\nInstead of putting something on wight:\n\tsay "The wight dodges you."\n\nInstead of throwing the dagger at wight:\n\tremove wight from play;\n\tmove the dagger to the location;\n\taward 1 point;\n\tsay "The dagger passes through its airy form with a rending like the rip of silk. The fragments dissipate at once."\n\nThe maximum score is 2.\n\nTest me with "hint about wight / north / get bar / south / open tomb / get dagger / south / hint about wight / read inscription / hint about wight / attack wight / throw dagger at wight / south".\n\n');

<p>We also need to deal with the question of whether the player has examined an object, for those objects whose descriptions carry vital information:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In practice, there might be other ways of getting vital facts, and in a more sophisticated puzzle game we might need a more sophisticated model to track this. But examined or unexamined will do for now.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what room is the ultimate location of (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be the holder of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the place is a thing, let the place be the holder of the place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the place is a room, decide on the place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what thing is the visible shell of (item - a thing):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if item is visible, decide on the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let place be the holder of the item;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while place is a thing and place is not visible, let place be the holder of the place;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the place is visible, decide on the place.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To say more:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[paragraph break]Shall I go on? > &quot;;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>That covers most of the generic hints, but let's also add some slightly more precise hints about a few kinds of objects that are especially important in the model world. These hints will probably not be very interesting to a seasoned IF veteran, but a novice player who does not know the wording or cannot guess what something might be for may still find them useful:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about a locked lockable thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could unlock [the noun] with [the matching key of the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of hinting about a locked thing when the matching key of the noun is not carried by the player:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player can see the matching key of the noun
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Perhaps [the matching key of the noun] would help.&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[The noun] is locked. There must be a key around somewhere. [More]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents, try hinting about the matching key of the noun;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about a closed openable unlocked thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could open [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about an open door:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could enter [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about an unexamined thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You might find out something if you examine [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about an edible thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could eat [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about a wearable thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could wear [the noun].&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about a pushable between rooms thing:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You could push [the noun] some direction.&quot; instead.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now to the actual objects in the game:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Crypt is a room. &quot;This squat, barrel-vaulted chamber runs roughly north-south. Along either side are the graves of Saxon kings and early bishops of the church long since gone to dust -- one [tomb] in particular looks undisturbed.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice that we used the bracketed tomb here: the tomb is scenery, and if we do not use the name-printing function, Inform will not register that we have mentioned it to the player.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The tomb is scenery in the Crypt. The tomb is openable and closed. The silver dagger is a thing in the tomb. Understand &quot;tombs&quot; as the tomb. The description of the silver dagger is &quot;Gleaming in a soft light all its own. Its blade is figured with running deer and its hilt is made of horn.&quot; The wight requires the silver dagger. The tomb require the pry bar.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of opening the tomb when the player does not carry the pry bar:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The lids are stone, too heavy for you to raise without some implement.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we can add specific hints to replace the generic ones:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about the tomb:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The lids are heavy, but you can open them when you carry the pry bar.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The rest of the hint system ensures that the player will not see this final suggestion until he has the pry bar, since the tomb &quot;requires&quot; the pry bar. Having the hint there doesn't excuse us from providing some alternate wording in case the player solves this not-very-difficult conundrum on his own, though:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;pry [something] with [something preferably held]&quot; as unlocking it with. Understand the commands &quot;lever&quot; or &quot;prise&quot; as &quot;pry&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of unlocking something with the pry bar, try opening the noun.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The wight is a man in the Crypt. &quot;[The wight] lurks near the south exit.&quot; The description of wight is &quot;Old English [italic type]wiht[roman type]: a thing, a creature. It is little more than the memory of a life ill-lived, but it lingers here.&quot; Understand &quot;wiht&quot; or &quot;creature&quot; or &quot;ghost&quot; as the wight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of going south in the presence of wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The wight breathes chill into your face.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Your head swims, and you are aware that you no longer have the willpower to go in that direction.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Fresh Air is south from the Crypt.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After going to Fresh Air:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 1 point;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Congratulations, you have escaped!&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the game in victory.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The inscription is fixed in place in the Crypt. &quot;Someone has painstakingly carved [an inscription] into the wall above the door.&quot; The description is &quot;Squinting, you decipher the Latin text: [italic type]Silver causes harm to those that live though dead[roman type].&quot; The inscription explains wight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Treasure Chamber is north of the Crypt. &quot;The walls are thick, the high windows promisingly barred with iron. But for all this there is no hint of any valuable stores remaining.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The pry bar is in the Treasure Chamber. &quot;One of the window bars, rusted from its place, lies in a puddle of water.&quot; Understand &quot;window&quot; or &quot;bars&quot; as the pry bar. The description of the pry bar is &quot;A few feet long, and not entirely rusted into uselessness yet.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving the dagger to wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The wight recoils, appalled.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out hinting about wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You will have to find some way to get wight to come in physical contact with the silver dagger, which he will certainly not do willingly. [More]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if player consents, say &quot;You could, for instance, throw it at him.&quot; instead;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise stop the action.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;touch [something] with [something]&quot; as putting it on (with nouns reversed). Understand &quot;hit [someone] with [something]&quot; as putting it on (with nouns reversed).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of attacking the wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;You can't force yourself to approach close enough for hand to hand combat: if, indeed, the wight has hands.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting the dagger on wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The wight fades out of your way without ever coming into contact with the dagger. Perhaps a more projectile method would work better.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of putting something on wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The wight dodges you.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of throwing the dagger at wight:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remove wight from play;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move the dagger to the location;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;award 1 point;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The dagger passes through its airy form with a rending like the rip of silk. The fragments dissipate at once.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The maximum score is 2.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;hint about wight / north / get bar / south / open tomb / get dagger / south / hint about wight / read inscription / hint about wight / attack wight / throw dagger at wight / south&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>(Note that, if using TEST ME to run through the solution, we will have to answer a few yes/no questions along the way.)
