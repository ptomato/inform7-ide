<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to multiply 122kg and 10kg, not because it could never make sense (a physicist will occasionally multiply two weights) but because the result is - what? Not a number, and not a weight any more. But we are allowed to tell Inform what the result ought to be, and once we have done so, the multiplication will be allowed:

<p>
<p>And having told Inform that lengths multiply to area, we could also divide an area by a length to get a length: no further instructions would be needed.
<p>
<p>Note that we are only allowed to make such a rule about multiplication, and only between units, and the result has to be a unit. So this system cannot be used to make Inform multiply, say, a time by a piece of text, nor to contradict any of the standard &quot;dimensional rules&quot; outlined above.

<p>In the following, we pretend that every item has a cuboidal shape. Every thing has a length, width and depth, while a &quot;measured container&quot; also has interior dimensions. (Thus a 10x10x10 container with 1cm-thick sides might have interior dimensions 9x9x9.)

<p>Several warnings about this. First, the numbers can't go very high (if the Settings for the project set the story file format to the Z-machine): while the volume can in theory go to 32,767, in practice this equates to an object 32 cm on a side, which is not very large. One way to avoid this is to use the Glulx format, allowing for sizes in excess of 10 m on a side: or we could simply scale the dimensions to suit our purposes, using a decimeter (10 cm) as the basic unit of measurement, for instance.
<p>
<p>Second, the system will require a height, width, and depth for every portable object in the game, which is a large commitment to data entry; it may become tiresome. So it is probably not worth bothering with this kind of simulation unless it is going to be genuinely significant.
