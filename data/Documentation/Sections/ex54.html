<p>
<p>1. A <b>scene</b> is a stretch of time somewhere in our narrative. We might choose to use scenes to organize the entire structure of our plot; just for timed or occasional events; or not at all, as we prefer.
<p>
<p>Scenes are a flexible way to keep an eye on and react to complex aspects of the world state, so they might for instance be used to monitor whether or not puzzles have been completed, determine when it is time to move the player to a new location, provide background activity, and so on.
<p>
<p>2. We define a new scene with
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop is a scene.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>A scene has only a single beginning but is allowed to have many different named endings. We indicate how our scenes are to begin and end like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Train Stop begins when ...
<br>Train Stop ends when ...
<br>Duel to the Death ends tragically when ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>These need not be simple rules. If necessary, long wordy conditions can be given: or, using techniques from the chapter on phrases, we could define a phrase to make a really complicated decision.
<p>
<p>Scenes cannot be begun or ended just by saying so, using &quot;now&quot;. Although the condition &quot;the Horrible Argument is happening&quot; correctly tests for whether this scene is under way, demands like &quot;now the Horrible Argument is happening&quot; or &quot;now the Duel to the Death has ended&quot; are not allowed - scenes begin and end only when the conditions are met. There are several reasons for this, but one is that it makes it possible for the Scene Index to keep track of how scenes fit together in the course of our story.
<p>
<p>3. Just as rooms are joined together by map connections, we can join scenes together so that they lead one into another or run in parallel:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Passenger Throng ends when Train Stop ends.
<br>Train Departure begins when Train Stop ends.
<br>Train Departure ends when Nightfall begins.
<br>Owl Screeching begins when Nightfall begins.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Or we can say that a scene begins &quot;when play begins&quot;.
<p>
<p>4. We can write rules applying during the scene like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Train Stop: ...
<br>Before taking the luggage during Train Stop: ...
<br>After listening when Train Stop is happening: ...
<br>Instead of going to the Outdoor Region during Train Stop: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We may also check afterward whether a scene has happened:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of kissing Miss Tilford when Train Stop has happened: ...
<br>&quot;The Waiting Room is freshly painted.[if Train Stop has ended] But it somehow seems desolate now.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on. For instance, we could use such conditions to assemble a summary of the plot so far for the player.
<p>
<p>5. More than one scene can be happening at the same time, so it is not sensible to talk about &quot;the current scene&quot;, in the way that we talk about the location of the player. The player can only be in one room at a time, but he can be in the midst of multiple scenes (or none).

<p>
<p>As we have seen, there are a number of different ways of controlling conversation in interactive fiction, and the best choice of way will depend quite a lot on what kind of work we're writing.
<p>
<p>One common model is to replace Inform's default ASK and TELL commands with a TALK TO command. This gives the player less control than he would otherwise have: instead of asking a character about any topic under the sun, he's restricted to seeing (or not seeing) a single sequence of text that the author has written in advance. On the other hand, such a system is harder for the player to break (since he can never ask about a topic that the author hasn't implemented), and easier for the author to tie into plot developments. If we give TALK TO different output at each scene, we get conversation that is always tied to the current state of the plot.
<p>
<p>This is a design approach that works best in a game with a large number of short, focused scenes. For other kinds of conversation system design, compare the other examples listed in the Recipe Book.

During the prologue of the play, no one else is on-stage, and the player is to address the audience directly:]\n\nSection 1 - Prologue\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tchange right hand status line to "416 BC";\n\tchange left hand status line to "[location]"\n\nPrologue is a scene. Prologue begins when play begins.\n\nThe Theater of Dionysus is a room.\n\nThe audience is a person in the Theater. "The usual audience looks on: the priests and judges in the front row, and then Athenians, metics, and foreigners." The audience can be prepared or unprepared. The description is "Have you ever seen such a company of perjurers, pathics, and thieves?" Understand "priest" or "priests" or "priest of dionysus" or "judge" or "judges" or "athenians" or "metics" or "foreigners" as the audience.\n\nInstead of talking to the player when the Prologue is happening:\n\tsay "There will be plenty of occasion for muttered asides later in the play, but for now you must prepare the audience for things to come."\n\nInstead of talking to the audience when the Prologue is happening:\n\tsay "Drawing breath, you turn to the audience, and offer them a genial, witty, colorful, and of course crude synopsis of what they are about to see; describing all the characters in unmistakable terms and not omitting the most important of them all, your august self.";\n\tnow the audience is prepared.\n\nInstead of talking to the audience when the Prologue has happened:\n\tsay "You may only direct monologues to the audience when the other actors are off-stage. Otherwise, their characters might have to notice."\n\nPrologue ends when the audience is prepared.\n\n[But there might follow a scene in which the player shouldn\'t talk at all:]\n\nSection 2 - Parodos\n\nParodos is a scene. Parodos begins when Prologue ends.\n\nWhen Parodos begins:\n\tmove the chorus to the theater;\n\nInstead of talking to someone during Parodos:\n\tsay "Sssh: this moment belongs to the chorus. They\'ve worked so hard on it, after all."\n\nParodos ends when the time since Parodos began is 4 minutes.\n\nThe chorus is a person.

[The audience] appear to be pricing their costumes to the nearest obol: woe to the producer who cheats them of their due share of spectacle."\n\n[And now a scene in which the player can talk several times to a character (Heracles) but has no useful dialogue with the chorus, the audience, or himself. The prohibition from talking to the audience after the Prologue is already written, but we\'ll supply some appropriate responses for talking to the player or the chorus during this scene:]\n\nSection 3 - Episode\n\nEpisode is a scene. Episode begins when Parodos ends.\n\nWhen Episode begins:\n\tmove Heracles to the theater;\n\tsay "The chorus falls silent, which is the cue: Heracles bursts out of the scene building."\n\nHeracles is a man. The description is "Hard to mistake in his lion skin and boots, and carrying a formidable club." Heracles wears a lion skin and boots. He carries a formidable club. Heracles can be placid or annoyed. Heracles is placid. Heracles can be satisfied, intrigued, or unsatisfied. Heracles is unsatisfied.\n\nInstead of talking to the chorus during Episode:\n\tsay "Your improvised flirtation with the chorus raises no response but a crude gesture from the chorus-leader, who seems to be modeling the role on Iambe."\n\nInstead of talking to the player during Episode:\n\tif Heracles is annoyed\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "You mutter to yourself about men with more appetite than brain.

[paragraph break]\'Speak on, little man,\' he says.";\n\tnow Heracles is intrigued.\n\nInstead of talking to Heracles when Heracles is intrigued during Episode:\n\tsay "It takes several exchanges for him to wrap his one-inch brain around your ten-inch plan; but in the end he embraces the scheme, the women, and your humble self.";\n\tnow Heracles is satisfied.\n\nEvery turn when not talking to someone during Episode:\n\trepeat through Table of Episodic Events\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "[output entry][paragraph break]";\n\t\tblank out the whole row;\n\t\tmake no decision;\n\tend repeat.\n\nTable of Episodic Events\noutput\n"With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be."\n"In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets."\n"Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak."\n"Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread."\n"The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year\'s Lenaia winner, \'The Bees\'. With a jolt, you realize that you\'ve missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you."\n"Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron."\n"The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row."\n"Inspired by Euripides[\'] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don\'t speak at last, the play will come to a halt."\n"Silence descends."\n\nRule for writing a paragraph about Heracles during Episode:\n\tsay "[Heracles] stands at the center of the orchestra, with members of [the chorus] ranged on either side. [paragraph break][The audience] appear to be reserving their judgement, though they show signs of restiveness at the usual jokes: must there be a Heracles in [italic type]every[roman type] play?"\n\nEpisode ends successfully when Heracles is satisfied.\n\nWhen Episode ends successfully:\n\tsay "That, of course, is your cue: you\'re to come back on as Pan thirty verses from now, and it takes time to put on the hooves and the woolly-legged trousers.";\n\tend the game saying "You exit".\n\nEpisode ends disastrously when the number of filled rows in the Table of Episodic Events is 0.\n\nWhen Episode ends disastrously:\n\tend the game saying "The production has crashed to a halt".\n\nTest me with "ask audience about me / tell audience about me / audience, hello / audience, jump / talk to me / talk to audience / g / talk to chorus / look / x heracles / talk to me / talk to audience / z / look / talk to heracles / g".\n\n');

<p>
<p>But there might follow a scene in which the player shouldn't talk at all:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 2 - Parodos
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Parodos is a scene. Parodos begins when Prologue ends.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">When Parodos begins:

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of talking to someone during Parodos:

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Parodos ends when the time since Parodos began is 4 minutes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The chorus is a person.

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Every turn during Parodos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat through Table of Choral Events
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;[output entry][paragraph break]&quot;;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blank out the whole row;

<br>output
<br>&quot;The chorus now begins its entry, accompanying with anapestic song its march up the eisodos.&quot;
<br>&quot;The chorus draws nearer, stomping and clomping and swinging their baskets of cheese.&quot;
<br>&quot;You stand aside as the chorus fills the orchestra and dances to and fro.&quot;
<br>&quot;The tune of the aulos-player grows more and more frenzied and then breaks off.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last rule is a refinement borrowing from the Activities chapter, which gives characters different appearances in room descriptions depending on when we happen to look; because of the action of the play, we want to show the chorus and audience doing different things during different scenes.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Rule for writing a paragraph about the chorus during Parodos:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The chorus are dancing and singing their way[if the time since Parodos began is less than 3 minutes] up the long walkways onto the stage[otherwise] into position in the orchestra[end if]. [The audience] appear to be pricing their costumes to the nearest obol: woe to the producer who cheats them of their due share of spectacle.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And now a scene in which the player can talk several times to a character (Heracles) but has no useful dialogue with the chorus, the audience, or himself. The prohibition from talking to the audience after the Prologue is already written, but we'll supply some appropriate responses for talking to the player or the chorus during this scene:

<br>&quot;With a fart and a roar, Heracles asks the world at large, and you in particular, where his dinner might be.&quot;
<br>&quot;In epic diction, Heracles invites the dairy-mistresses, whey-matrons, and concubines of curd to supply him a supper from their ample baskets.&quot;
<br>&quot;Heracles and the chorus banter about the proclivities of cheese-wives. The chorus suggest that Heracles, as a son of Zeus, must know something about the appetites of which they speak.&quot;
<br>&quot;Heracles boasts that a man like himself can perform any feat, but only when his belly is full. Coyly, the matrons prance and dance, skip and gambol out of his grasp, singing mockingly about heads of garlic and loaves of sesame-crusted bread.&quot;
<br>&quot;The song of the feta fanciers now turns to pots of honey and new-made wine, borrowing verses from last year's Lenaia winner, 'The Bees'. With a jolt, you realize that you've missed your cue and the chorus are filling in for you.&quot;
<br>&quot;Playing for time, the chorus-leader elaborates a whole banquet: rabbit stew, shanks of lamb, spitted quails, eels from lake Copais. Heracles looks as near swooning as any girl fresh from Brauron.&quot;
<br>&quot;The chorus-leader extends the list of delicacies to include ox-brains, ham-hocks, barley, mullet, carrots, pigeons, lentils, radishes, peas, and apples both wine-dark and golden. The audience shifts on the benches. An expression of gloom settles over the Priest of Dionysus in the front row.&quot;
<br>&quot;Inspired by Euripides['] own Muse, the chorus-leader invents a mock-Alcaean hymn on the merits of chervil. This is clearly his swan-song: if you don't speak at last, the play will come to a halt.&quot;
<br>&quot;Silence descends.&quot;
