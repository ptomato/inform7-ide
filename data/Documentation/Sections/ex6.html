New commands for old grammar</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>In the photography example, we are providing entirely new grammar for an action  not ordinarily built in to Inform. But we often want simply to provide alternative grammar for existing actions, or even to put new interpretations on commands that Inform already recognises. For instance:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;deposit [something] in [an open container]&quot; as inserting it into.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The inserting action is built in to Inform, but the command &quot;deposit&quot; is not, so this is created as new. It is occasionally useful to put a twist on this:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;fill [an open container] with [something]&quot; as inserting it into (with nouns reversed).
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The clause &quot;(with nouns reversed)&quot; tells Inform to exchange the two nouns parsed, which is necessary because the inserting action expects the noun to be the item and the second noun to be the container, not vice versa.
<p>
<p>The following example:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;access [something]&quot; as opening.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>might look as if it makes &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot; when the player types it, but that's not so: &quot;open&quot; can also be used in constructions like &quot;open the door with the brass key&quot;, in which case it is understood as the unlocking action. We could add another line to make &quot;access&quot; behave this way too, but if what we really want is to make &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot;, it's easier simply to say so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the command &quot;access&quot; as &quot;open&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This is very useful when adding a new command which needs synonyms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the commands &quot;snap&quot; and &quot;picture&quot; as &quot;photograph&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We can check the current stock of commands by looking at the table in the Actions index: for instance, before making &quot;snap&quot; synonymous with &quot;photograph&quot;, it might be wise to check that it is not already defined as a command for breaking something.

<p>This example takes the ordering of grammar lines to its logical extreme, sorting the player's input into different categories depending on the kind and condition of the objects mentioned.

<p>Whether we actually want a USE action is a subject of some theoretical debate in the IF community. On the one hand, it helps avoid guess-the-verb problems where the player cannot figure out what term to use in order to express a fairly simple idea. On the other, it encourages the player to think that all items have one and exactly one use, rather than getting him to consider the range of possibilities that arise from having a complex vocabulary.
