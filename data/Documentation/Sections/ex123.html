<p>
<p>Sometimes we want to introduce random behaviour into play. We usually do this by generating random values, and then acting differently depending on what they are. The following:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">a random number from 2 to 5
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>produces, as it suggests, a random number drawn from the choices 2, 3, 4 or 5, each of which is equally likely to come up.
<p>
<p>We can also use random conditions:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here is a rule which applies only 15% of the time:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of waiting when a random chance of 15 in 100 succeeds: ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we make a new kind of value, we can also take random values from it, as in the following miniature world:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode21(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Weathering"\n\nA cloud pattern is a kind of value. The cloud patterns are cumulus, altocumulus, cumulonimbus, stratus, cirrus, nimbus, nimbostratus.\n\nThe Mount Pisgah Station is a room. "The rocky peak of Mt. Pisgah (altitude 872m) is graced only by an automatic weather station. The clouds, close enough almost to touch, are [a random cloud pattern]. Temperature: [a random number from 7 to 17] degrees, barometric pressure: [950 + a random number from 0 to 15] millibars."\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode21()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Weathering&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A cloud pattern is a kind of value. The cloud patterns are cumulus, altocumulus, cumulonimbus, stratus, cirrus, nimbus, nimbostratus.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Mount Pisgah Station is a room. &quot;The rocky peak of Mt. Pisgah (altitude 872m) is graced only by an automatic weather station. The clouds, close enough almost to touch, are [a random cloud pattern]. Temperature: [a random number from 7 to 17] degrees, barometric pressure: [950 + a random number from 0 to 15] millibars.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The value &quot;a random cloud pattern&quot; produces a random choice from the seven cloud patterns, each equally likely.
<p>
<p>Testing IF which makes random choices can be rather frustrating, because a problem showing up on one attempt may not show up on another. To ease testing, the following sentence will &quot;fix&quot; the process of generating these random numbers so that they are not random at all - the same sequence of random numbers will be produced on each run.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode22(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('When play begins, seed the random-number generator with 1234.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode22()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> When play begins, seed the random-number generator with 1234.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The seed value &quot;1234&quot; can be anything positive; a different sequence of random numbers will be produced for each different seed value. A seed value of 0 restores the RNG to properly random behaviour again.

<p>Suppose we have an urban space we want to populate with random passers-by. These should have a range of characteristics and not always be described in the same way; and once the player has noticed one, he should be able to look at her further, until another pedestrian crosses his path.
