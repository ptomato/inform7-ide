<p>
<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken. After dropping the china pot: say &quot;Crack!&quot;; now the china pot is broken; change the printed name of the pot to &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode62(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Terracotta"\n\nA flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.\n\nAfter dropping an unbroken flowerpot: say "Crack!"; now the noun is broken; change the printed name of the noun to "broken flowerpot"; change the printed plural name of the noun to "broken flowerpots".\n\nThe Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode62()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> &quot;Terracotta&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">After dropping an unbroken flowerpot: say &quot;Crack!&quot;; now the noun is broken; change the printed name of the noun to &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;; change the printed plural name of the noun to &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We then have the dialogue:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Herb Garden
<br>You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br>>get two flowerpots
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>flowerpot: Taken.
<br>>drop all
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>flowerpot: Crack!
<br>>look
<br>Herb Garden
<br>You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br>>get an unbroken flowerpot
<br>Taken.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>and so on and so forth.
<p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br>Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.

<p>Understand the property... runs into limitations when the property is itself a numerical value of arbitrary components. Even so, it is possible to work around this limitation and allow the player to refer to such entities as &quot;the 10 inch piece of string&quot;, even though &quot;10 inch&quot; is not a permanent part of the string's name. First, to echo the string example we had earlier:
<p>

<p>
<p>And now we intervene after the command has been read but before it is translated by Inform into a command. (For more about &quot;after reading a command&quot;, see the activities chapter.)
