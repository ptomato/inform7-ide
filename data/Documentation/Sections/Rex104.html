Money</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>Money could be anything which the two people in a bargain both agree is valuable. Here, the player and an ogre agree on a copper coin as money:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The player carries a copper coin. The ogre carries a rock cake. The cake is edible.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of giving the coin to the ogre:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the ogre carries the coin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the player carries the cake;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;The ogre grunts and hands you a rock cake.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now Inform does provide an action, &quot;buying&quot;, and a command for it, BUY, but they ordinarily respond simply &quot;Nothing is on sale.&quot; This is no longer true, so we should make BUY CAKE work. The difficulty here is that a command like BUY CAKE does not specify what should be handed over in exchange. Here we just check that the player has the coin, but in principle we could check for any of a range of monetary tokens - coins, notes, cheque book, debit card, and so on.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Instead of buying the cake:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player has the coin, try giving the coin to the ogre;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise say &quot;You have no money.&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In more advanced economies, where shopping replaces barter, the seller will stock a wide range of differently priced goods. For a tabulated catalogue of wares, see <b>Introduction to Juggling</b>: to allow the player to negotiate prices, see <b>Money for Nothing</b>. In both of those examples, the player's current financial worth is simulated only as a current total amount of money carried - say, $2.50. This is typical, because in most situations what matters is how much money is in the pocket, not how it is made up. Money behaves more like a liquid than a set of items: hence terms like &quot;liquidity&quot;, &quot;cash flow&quot; or <b>Frozen Assets</b> - the name of the simplest example demonstrating this. If we really need a comprehensive simulation down to pieces of currency - where it makes a difference carrying four quarters rather than a dollar bill, because the quarters can be fed into a vending machine - see <b>Nickel and Dimed</b>.

<p>
<p>Typically games which keep track of the player's wealth need only do so as an abstract number, but occasionally it becomes useful to represent money as physical coins and bills. Here is an example that does exactly that:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode717(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('"Nickel and Dimed"\n\nSection 1 - Currency\n\nPrice is a kind of value. $10.99 specifies a price with parts dollars and cents. A thing has a price. The price of a thing is usually $0.00.\n\nMoney is a kind of thing. Coin is a kind of money.\n\nA dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of a dollar bill is $1.00. The printed name of a dollar bill is "dollar bill". Rule for printing the plural name of a dollar bill: say "dollar bills". The description of a dollar bill is "It has George Washington\'s head on the front, which with a bit of creative folding can be scrunched to look like a mushroom. All important things really are learned in kindergarten."\n\nA five-dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of a five-dollar bill is $5.00. Understand "five" or "five dollar" as the five-dollar bill. The description of a five-dollar bill is "Abraham Lincoln. He looks slightly less dignified here than he does on the penny."\n\nA hundred-dollar bill is a kind of money. The price of the hundred-dollar bill is $100.00. Understand "hundred" or "hundred dollar" as the hundred-dollar bill. Understand "dollar" as the dollar bill. The description of a hundred-dollar bill is "It\'s got Benjamin Franklin, who always gets shafted: a denomination too large for anyone to carry conveniently, and a lot of local fame in Philadelphia."\n\n[Our choice of understand rules guarantees that "five dollar" will be understood as the five, but "dollar" alone as the single. We will learn more about "understand" in later chapters, but here is a test to check the functionality:]\n\nTest bills with "x hundred dollar bill / x five dollar bill / x hundred / x five / x dollar / x dollar bill".\n\nA quarter is a kind of coin. The price of a quarter is $0.25. The description of a quarter is "One of the old-fashioned variety, not a state quarter."\n\nA dime is a kind of coin. The price of a dime is $0.10. The description of a dime is "Franklin Roosevelt, trying not to look too annoyed that his coin is so small and thin."\n\nA nickel is a kind of coin. The price of a nickel is $0.05. The description of a nickel is "A chubby coin, but you\'ve always liked Thomas Jefferson, and the Monticello on the back is a nice touch."\n\nA penny is a kind of coin. The price of a penny is $0.01. The description of the penny is "A profile Abe Lincoln. Sometime soon they\'ll stop minting these, you\'re sure of it."\n\nSection 2 - Ownership\n\nOwnership relates one person (called the owner) to various things. The verb to own (he owns, they own, he owned, he is owned) implies the ownership relation.\n\nDefinition: a thing is owned if the player owns it.\n\nInstead of buying something which is owned by the player:\n\tsay "You already own [the noun]."\n\nInstead of going somewhere when the player encloses something (called the stolen goods) which is not owned by the player:\n\tif the owner of the stolen goods is not a person\n\tbegin;\n\t\tnow the player owns the stolen goods;\n\t\tcontinue the action;\n\tend if;\n\tif the owner of the stolen goods can see the player,\n\t\tsay "\'Hey there buddy, not so fast,\' says [the owner of the stolen goods]. \'You going to buy [the stolen goods] first, or am I gonna call the cops?\'";\n\totherwise continue the action.\n\nAfter taking inventory:\n\tsay "Altogether, you\'ve got [the player\'s cash] on your person."\n\nTo decide what price is the player\'s cash:\n\tlet sum be the total price of money enclosed by the player;\n\tdecide on sum.\n\nTo decide what price is the sum in (item - a container):\n\tlet sum be the total price of the money in the item;\n\tdecide on sum.\n\nWhen play begins: now every thing carried by the player is owned by the player.\n\nSection 3 - Purchasing and Sales\n\nDefinition: a thing is worthless if the price of it is $0.00. Definition: a thing is valuable if it is not worthless.\n\nA thing can be for sale.\n\nRule for printing room description details of something (called target) which is for sale (this is the disclose prices in room description rule): say " ([price of the target])".\n\nBefore listing contents: group money together giving articles.\n\nInstead of examining a for sale thing (this is the describe things by price rule):\n\tsay "[The noun] costs [the price of the noun], payable to [the owner of the noun]."\n\n[The cashbox is a theoretical construct, not something the player will ever encounter in the course of the game. It contains all the money that is available for non-player characters to use in making change. If we wanted, we could give each character his own stash of change, but this would increase the likelihood that any given person would run out of cash to make change with. (And in this example there is only one vendor anyway.)]\n\nThe cashbox is a container. The cashbox contains 10 pennies. The cashbox contains 10 nickels.  The cashbox contains 10 dimes.  The cashbox contains 10 quarters.  The cashbox contains 10 dollar bills.  The cashbox contains 10 five-dollar bills.\n\nThe block buying rule is not listed in the check buying rules.\n\nCheck buying something:\n\tif the noun is not for sale, say "[The owner of the noun] does not want to sell you [the noun]." instead;\n\tif the player\'s cash is less than the price of the noun, say "You can\'t afford the asking price of [the price of the noun] for [the noun]." instead.\n\nCarry out buying something:\n\tlet sum paid be $0.00;\n\twhile sum paid is less than the price of the noun\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet current target be the price of the noun minus the sum paid;\n\t\tlet bill offered be the best money from the player for the current target;\n\t\tif the bill offered is money\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tmove the bill offered to the owner of the noun;\n\t\t\tnow the bill offered is spent;\n\t\t\tincrease the sum paid by the price of the bill offered;\n\t\t\tlet current target be the price of the noun minus the sum paid;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend while;\n\tsay "You hand [the owner of the noun] [a list of spent money]. [run paragraph on]";\n\tif the sum paid is greater than the price of the noun, let change be the sum paid minus the price of the noun;\n\tif change is greater than the sum in the cashbox\n\tbegin;\n\t\tnow the player carries every spent money;\n\t\tnow every spent thing is fresh;\n\t\tsay "\'Whoa,\' says [the owner of the noun], handing the cash back to you. \'I can\'t make change for that, man, sorry.\'" instead;\n\tend if;\n\tnow every spent thing is in the cashbox;\n\tnow every spent thing is fresh;\n\twhile change is greater than $0.00\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet change bill be the best money from the cashbox for change;\n\t\tdecrease change by the price of the change bill;\n\t\tnow change bill is spent;\n\t\tmove change bill to player;\n\tend while;\n\tif money is spent, say "[The owner of the noun] makes change with [a list of spent money]. [run paragraph on]";\n\tnow every spent thing is fresh;\n\tif the noun is not enclosed by the player and the owner of the noun can touch the noun\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "\'Here ya go,\' says [the owner of the noun], handing [the noun] to you. [run paragraph on]";\n\t\tmove the noun to the player;\n\tend if;\n\tnow the player owns the noun.\n\nMoney can be spent or fresh.\n\nReport buying something:\n\tif the player owns the noun,\n\t\tsay "Your transaction is now complete, leaving you with [the player\'s cash]."\n\n[We\'ve skipped over defining what makes a denomination the best for a given transaction, so we\'d better do that now. Our goal is to avoid ever having the player gratuitously overpay -- he should always offer the smallest amount of money that will meet the price of what he\'s buying.]\n\n[We also assume that all money "enclosed by the buyer" -- that is, somewhere in the buyer\'s possession -- is available for use. This might not be true in a game where the player could pick up, say, a sealed lucite container with a ten-dollar bill inside; in that case we would have to define our terms more rigorously, perhaps by requiring that the bills be both enclosed and touchable by the buyer. The touchability check adds an extra layer of calculation, however, and since it is not necessary in this example (and probably not in most other cases either), we\'ll leave it out:]\n\nDefinition: money is costly if its price is $2.50 or more. Definition: money is cheap if its price is $0.99 or less.\n\nFunctional relation is a kind of value. The functional relations are overpayment, underpayment, or irrelevant. Money has a functional relation.\n\nTo decide what money is the best money from (buyer - a thing) for (cost - a price):\n\trepeat with bill offered running through money\n\tbegin;\n\t\tif the bill offered is enclosed by the buyer\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tif the price of the bill offered is the cost, decide on the bill offered;\n\t\t\tif the price of the bill offered is greater than the cost, change the functional relation of bill offered to overpayment;\n\t\t\totherwise change the functional relation of the bill offered to underpayment;\n\t\totherwise;\n\t\t\tchange the functional relation of the bill offered to irrelevant;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend repeat;\n\t[say "underpayment: [a list of underpayment money]\n\toverpayment: [a list of overpayment money]";]\n\tif the total price of underpayment money is less than the cost\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet desired bill be the cheapest money which is overpayment;\n\totherwise;\n\t\tlet the desired bill be the costliest money which is underpayment;\n\tend if;\n\tdecide on the desired bill.\n\n[Notice the "say underpayment/overpayment section..." noted out, above. This is for debugging purposes: when writing complex code, it is sometimes useful to put in lines that will say explicitly what is going on. We can enclose them in brackets and Inform will ignore them as though they were comments; if we run into any problems with the code later, we can erase the brackets and see the diagnostic printed to the screen as we play.]\n\nInstead of giving money to someone:\n\tsay "Best to keep the transaction simple by buying whatever you want."\n\nSection 4 - The Scenario\n\nThe player carries 2 dollar bills. The player carries a nickel. The player carries 2 pennies. The player carries a five-dollar bill. The player carries 1 hundred-dollar bill.\n\nThe Subway Station is a room.\n\nThe Bitterly Cold Street is north of the Subway Station. "Even though there is no actual snow or ice, the street is about as cold as you can stand, for which reason walking the twenty blocks uptown is not an acceptable option." The Bitterly Cold Street contains a dollar bill.\n\nThe newspaper man is a man in the Subway Station. "A newspaper man in a knit cap and fingerless gloves is hopping up and down behind his stand[if the turn count is 1]. Cold weather, caffeine overdose, or mental illness? You may never know. Welcome to New York[end if]." The description is "Eye contact with strangers is something to avoid around here."\n\nThe stand is a supporter in the Station. The stand is scenery.\n\nA copy of the New York Times is on the stand. The price of the New York Times is $1.25.\n\nA pack of gum is on the stand. The price of the gum is $0.40.\n\nA paperback novel is on the stand. The price of the paperback novel is $7.99.\n\nA packet of trading cards is on the stand. The price of the packet is $0.99.\n\nWhen play begins:\n\tnow every thing on the stand is owned by the newspaper man;\n\tnow every thing on the stand is for sale.\n\n[We could have done all that by hand, but the initialization requires a little less work.]\n\nThe ticket machine is a container in the Subway Station. It is fixed in place. The description of the ticket machine is "An LED screen on the front instructs you to insert [remaining ticket total] to complete your purchase. You also notice that the NO CHANGE light is lit up." The light is part of the ticket machine. The printed name of the light is "no change light". Understand "no change" or "no change light" as the light.\n\nThe description of the light is "In the whole of your recollection, the ticket machine has actually had change a total of twice. Usually, as now, the no-change light gleams angrily, daring you to put in more than you owe." A cash return button is part of the ticket machine. Instead of pushing the cash return button: say "The ticket machine regurgitates [the list of things in the ticket machine]."; now every thing in the ticket machine is carried by the player. Instead of taking something which is in the ticket machine: say "The ticket machine has swallowed your money, but it can be retrieved (you hope) with the cash return button."\n\nInstead of inserting a hundred-dollar bill into the ticket machine:\n\tsay "What, are you nuts?"\n\nTo decide what price is the remaining ticket total:\n\tlet absolute cost be $2.25;\n\tlet remaining cost be absolute cost minus the total price of things in the ticket machine;\n\tif remaining cost is less than $0.00, decide on $0.00;\n\tdecide on remaining cost.\n\nInstead of inserting something which is not money into the ticket machine: say "The ticket machine only accepts money, not other tokens of your esteem and regard."\n\nInstead of inserting a penny into the ticket machine:\n\tsay "The penny rattles out again mockingly: not even the ticket machine thinks these are worth anything."\n\nA subway pass is a kind of thing. 15 subway passes are in the cashbox. The description of a subway pass is usually "A rectangle of thick lavender paper with a black magnetic stripe running up the back side. It is good for one trip on the subway."\n\nAfter inserting something into the ticket machine:\n\tif the remaining ticket total is $0.00\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet purchased ticket be a random subway pass in the cashbox;\n\t\tif purchased ticket is not a subway pass, say "The ticket machine grunts disobligingly and then the unwelcome words MALFUNCTION parade across the LED screen, three letters at a time." instead;\n\t\trepeat with item running through things in the machine\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tremove item from play;\n\t\tend repeat;\n\t\tmove purchased ticket to player;\n\t\tsay "The ticket machine beeps obligingly and disgorges a single subway pass.";\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay "The ticket machine beeps obligingly and adjusts its price down to [remaining ticket total].";\n\tend if.\n\n[And because even though the ticket machine is a container, we don\'t want to say (empty) after it in the room description:]\n\nRule for printing room description details of the ticket machine:\n\tdo nothing instead.\n\nTest me with "buy novel / n / get dollar / s / buy novel".\n\n[After all that, we should probably give the player a chance to win, as well:]\n\nThe turnstile is south of the Subway Station. "A turnstile is all that separates you from the subway platform stairs." The turnstile is north of the Platform. The turnstile is a door. Before going down in the presence of the turnstile, try going south instead. The turnstile is openable. The turnstile is open.\n\nInstead of going through the turnstile when the player carries a subway pass: say "You enter the turnstile and begin your journey uptown..."; end the game saying "At last". Instead of going through the turnstile: say "You can\'t go through the turnstile without a subway pass. They\'re very strict about this."\n\nInstead of inserting money into the turnstile: say "The turnstile takes passes, not money." Instead of inserting a subway pass into the turnstile, try entering the turnstile.\n\nTest more with "buy times / put all but five-dollar bill in machine / press button / buy gum / buy cards / i / put dollar in machine / g / put quarter in machine / i / d".\n\n');

<p>Our choice of understand rules guarantees that &quot;five dollar&quot; will be understood as the five, but &quot;dollar&quot; alone as the single. We will learn more about &quot;understand&quot; in later chapters, but here is a test to check the functionality:

<p>The cashbox is a theoretical construct, not something the player will ever encounter in the course of the game. It contains all the money that is available for non-player characters to use in making change. If we wanted, we could give each character his own stash of change, but this would increase the likelihood that any given person would run out of cash to make change with. (And in this example there is only one vendor anyway.)

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>We've skipped over defining what makes a denomination the best for a given transaction, so we'd better do that now. Our goal is to avoid ever having the player gratuitously overpay -- he should always offer the smallest amount of money that will meet the price of what he's buying.
<p>
<p>We also assume that all money &quot;enclosed by the buyer&quot; -- that is, somewhere in the buyer's possession -- is available for use. This might not be true in a game where the player could pick up, say, a sealed lucite container with a ten-dollar bill inside; in that case we would have to define our terms more rigorously, perhaps by requiring that the bills be both enclosed and touchable by the buyer. The touchability check adds an extra layer of calculation, however, and since it is not necessary in this example (and probably not in most other cases either), we'll leave it out:
<p>

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Functional relation is a kind of value. The functional relations are overpayment, underpayment, or irrelevant. Money has a functional relation.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide what money is the best money from (buyer - a thing) for (cost - a price):

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;

</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Notice the &quot;say underpayment/overpayment section...&quot; noted out, above. This is for debugging purposes: when writing complex code, it is sometimes useful to put in lines that will say explicitly what is going on. We can enclose them in brackets and Inform will ignore them as though they were comments; if we run into any problems with the code later, we can erase the brackets and see the diagnostic printed to the screen as we play.

<p>In fairness to the Metropolitan Transit Authority, we should admit that most of the ticketing machines in the real New York subway are better than this, and will accept, say, a debit card. But that would be so much less exciting to implement.
