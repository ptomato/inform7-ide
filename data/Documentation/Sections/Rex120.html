<p>
<p>Most toys are single things, and no harder to create than any other small items, but games often require a multitude of tokens to be combined, and this can be logistically tricky.
<p>
<p>The classic example is a pack of playing cards, where the player must individually control 52 items but without fussy commands or verbose text being printed back. <b>Jokers Wild</b> provides a simple &quot;one card at a time&quot; approach; <b>Tilt 1</b> is more sophisticated, with 52 independently accessible cards; <b>Tilt 2</b> can further judge the value of a selection of cards - the ranking of a poker hand.
<p>
<p>Drawing cards from a shuffled pack is only one source of randomness. Games of chance also involve items drawn from a bag: <b>Wonka's Revenge</b> provides just such a lottery. More often, dice are thrown. A single die is easy enough:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The die is carried by the player. After dropping the die: say &quot;It lands with [a random number from 1 to 6] uppermost.&quot; Understand &quot;roll [something]&quot; as dropping.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Quick, but not very good. Most dice games involve rolling more than one die at a time, to get a more interesting distribution of outcomes: they may also involve special rules applying to doubles, for instance. See <b>Do Pass Go</b>.

<p>
<p>In our previous implementations of playing cards, we've gotten as far as creating decks of individual cards that the player can draw and discard. But in a poker game, one doesn't just have a collection of cards: one has a hand of a specific kind.
<p>
<p>Here we take on the job of writing an inventory listing for a poker hand that will reflect the real value of what the player has drawn. To do this, we create a rulebook to sort and assess the cards in the player's hand; its possible return values are limited to the kinds of poker hands that exist, from &quot;high card&quot; to &quot;royal flush&quot;.
<p>
<p>The first three sections, creating the deck of cards and the means to parse their names, are identical to those we've already seen in Tilt 1; new material begins at section 4.
<p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we're simulating something akin to five-card draw without wilds; stud or hold-em variations would add some other complexities.

"Nothing to see here."\n\nThe deck of cards is in the Empty Room. It is a closed unopenable container. The description is "A standard poker deck."\n\nThe discard pile is a closed unopenable container. The description is "Cards in this game are discarded face-down, so the discard pile is not very interesting to see. All you can observe is that it currently contains [if the number of cards which are in the discard pile is less than ten][the number of cards which are in the discard pile in words][otherwise]about [the rounded number of cards which are in the discard pile in words][end if] card[s]."\n\nTo decide what number is the rounded number of (described set - a description):\n\tlet N be the number of members of the described set;\n\tlet R be N divided by 5;\n\tlet total be R times 5;\n\tdecide on total.\n\nRule for printing room description details of something: do nothing instead.\n\nSection 3 - Drawing and Discarding Actions\n\nUnderstand the commands "take" and "carry" and "hold" and "get" and "drop" and "throw" and "discard" as something new.\n\nUnderstand "take [text]" or "get [text]" or "drop [text]" as a mistake ("Here, you only draw and discard. Nothing else matters at the moment.").\n\nUnderstand "draw" or "draw card" or "draw a card" as drawing. Drawing is an action applying to nothing. The drawing action has an object called the card drawn.\n\nSetting action variables for drawing:\n\tchange the card drawn to a random card which is in the deck of cards.\n\nCheck drawing:\n\tif the card drawn is nothing, say "The deck is completely depleted." instead.\n\nCheck drawing:\n\tif the number of cards carried by the player is greater than four,\n\t\tsay "This is a five-card game; you must discard something before drawing anything further." instead.\n\nCarry out drawing:\n\tmove the card drawn to the player.\n\nReport drawing:\n\tsay "You draw [a card drawn]."\n\n\nUnderstand "discard [card]" as discarding. Discarding is an action applying to one thing.\n\nCheck discarding:\n\tif the player does not carry the noun, say "You can only discard cards from your own hand." instead.\n\nCarry out discarding:\n\tnow the noun is in the discard pile;\n\tif the discard pile is not visible, move the discard pile to the location.\n\nReport discarding:\n\tsay "You toss [the noun] nonchalantly onto the discard pile."\n\n[New material begins here. We want to start by grouping cards together, but identifying poker hands only if the player holds a full five cards.]\n\nSection 4 - Assessing Hands\n\nBefore listing contents while taking inventory: group cards together.\n\nBefore grouping together cards:\n\tif the number of cards carried by the player is 5\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "[run paragraph on]";\n\t\tfollow the hand-ranking rules;\n\t\tif the rule succeeded, say "[the outcome of the rulebook]";\n\t\totherwise say "some random cards";\n\t\tif the outcome of the rulebook is pair outcome, say " of [rank of the first thing held by the player as a card value]s";\n\totherwise;\n\t\tsay "[number of cards carried by the player in words] assorted cards";\n\tend if;\n\tsay " (";\n\nRule for grouping together cards:\n\tsay "[list hand]".\n\nTo say list hand:\n\tlet chosen card be the first thing held by the player;\n\twhile chosen card is a card\n\tbegin;\n\t\tsay "[chosen card]";\n\t\tnow chosen card is the next thing held after chosen card;\n\t\tif chosen card is a card, say ", ";\n\tend while.\n\nAfter grouping together cards:\n\tsay ")";\n\n[The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:]\n\nThe hand-ranking rules is a rulebook. The hand-ranking rules have outcomes royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, high card.\n\nThe hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the flushness.\nThe hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the straightness.\n\nThe hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the pair count.\nThe hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the triple count.\nThe hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the quadruple count.\n\n[For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player\'s hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on "Looking at containment by hand" in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player\'s hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player\'s hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.]\n\nA card can be sorted or unsorted. A card is usually unsorted.\n\nDefinition: a card is high if its rank is 11 or more.\nDefinition: a card is low if its rank is 4 or less.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the initial sort rule):\n\tnow every card is unsorted;\n\twhile the player carries an unsorted card\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet item be the lowest unsorted card held by the player;\n\t\tmove item to the player;\n\t\tnow the item is sorted;\n\tend while;\n\tif sort-debugging is true, say "-- after initial sort: [list hand]".\n\n[This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we\'ll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it\'s on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.]\n\n[Next up, a check to see whether the player has a flush:]\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the finding flushness rule):\n\tlet called suit be the suit of a random card carried by the player;\n\tif every card carried by the player is called suit, change flushness to true.\n\n[Now we check for straights; this is slightly complicated by the fact that an ace can be either the bottom of a low straight (lower than 2) or the top of a high straight (higher than king), so we explicitly check both possibilities.]\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the finding straightness rule):\n\tchange straightness to true;\n\tlet N be the rank of the highest card which is carried by the player;\n\trepeat with current rank running from N - 4 to N\n\tbegin;\n\t\tchange the test rank to the current rank;\n\t\tif the player carries a matching card\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tdo nothing;\n\t\totherwise;\n\t\t\tif the current rank is N - 4 and the current rank is 9 and the player carries an ace card, do nothing; [this covers the case where an ace could be the top card of the sequence]\n\t\t\totherwise change straightness to false;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend repeat.\n\n[And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player\'s hand when we take inventory.]\n\nA card can be quadrupled, tripled, paired or uncombined.\n\nTest rank is a number that varies. Definition: a card is matching if its rank is the test rank.\n\n[This definition is a convenience so that we don\'t have to write so many explicit loops in the following rule:]\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the counting multiples rule):\n\tnow every card is uncombined;\n\trepeat with current rank running from 1 to 13\n\tbegin;\n\t\tchange test rank to current rank;\n\t\tlet N be the number of matching cards held by the player;\n\t\tif N is 4\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tincrease the quadruple count by 1;\n\t\t\tnow every matching card held by the player is quadrupled;\n\t\tend if;\n\t\tif N is 3\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tincrease the triple count by 1;\n\t\t\tnow every matching card held by the player is tripled;\n\t\tend if;\n\t\tif N is 2\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tincrease the pair count by 1;\n\t\t\tnow every matching card held by the player is paired;\n\t\tend if;\n\tend repeat;\n\n[Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:]\n\n[1) we want to list aces as high unless they are serving as the bottom of a low straight, in which case they should appear last;]\n\n[2) we want combinations to appear at the front of the list, sorted from highest value to lowest value: larger combinations first, then smaller combinations, and combinations of equal size sorted by rank.]\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the move aces up unless there\'s a low straight rule):\n\tif the straightness is true and the lowest card carried by the player is an ace card and the rank of the highest card carried by the player is 5,\n\t\tdo nothing;\n\totherwise\n\t\tnow every ace card which is carried by the player is carried by the player;\n\tif sort-debugging is true, say "-- after ace movement rule: [list hand]";\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the move pairs forward rule):\n\twhile the player carries a paired card\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet selection be the lowest paired card which is carried by the player;\n\t\tmove the selection to the player;\n\t\tnow the selection is uncombined;\n\tend while;\n\tif sort-debugging is true, say "-- after pairs movement: [list hand]";\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the raise ace pairs rule):\n\tif the player carries exactly two ace cards\n\tbegin;\n\t\trepeat with item running through ace cards which are carried by the player\n\t\tbegin;\n\t\t\tmove item to the player;\n\t\tend repeat;\n\tend if;\n\tif sort-debugging is true, say "-- after paired-ace movement: [list hand]";\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the move multiples forward rule):\n\twhile the player carries a tripled card\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet selection be the lowest tripled card which is carried by the player;\n\t\tmove the selection to the player;\n\t\tnow the selection is uncombined;\n\tend while;\n\twhile the player carries a quadrupled card\n\tbegin;\n\t\tlet selection be the lowest quadrupled card which is carried by the player;\n\t\tmove the selection to the player;\n\t\tnow the selection is uncombined;\n\tend while;\n\tif sort-debugging is true, say "-- after multiples movement rule: [list hand]";\n\nDefinition: a card is ace if its rank is 1.\nDefinition: a card is king if its rank is 13.\n\n[Now, having determined the salient qualities of our hand, we run through rules in order from the highest kind of poker combination to the lowest. Because of the order of the source, Inform will choose whichever combination applies first.]\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the royal-flush rule):\n\tif flushness is true and straightness is true and the highest card carried by the player is king and the lowest card carried by the player is ace, royal flush.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the straight-flushes rule):\n\tif flushness is true and straightness is true, straight flush.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the four-of-a-kind rule):\n\tif the quadruple count is 1, four of a kind.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the full-house rule):\n\tif the pair count is 1 and the triple count is 1, full house.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the flushes rule):\n\tif flushness is true, flush.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the straights rule):\n\tif straightness is true, straight.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the three-of-a-kind rule):\n\tif triple count is 1, three of a kind.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the two-pair rule):\n\tif the pair count is 2, two pairs.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the pair rule):\n\tif the pair count is 1, pair.\n\nA hand-ranking rule (this is the default rule):\n\thigh card.\n\n[And finally, we need to define our debugging variable here, even though we won\'t give the player the ability to turn it on and off except in the special testing section.]\n\nSort-debugging is a truth state that varies.\n\n[For many examples, a test-me script is enough to prove that the example does what it ought. This example, though, is a bit more complicated, and hard to test randomly. The remainder of the source here shows how we might write a test to verify the desired behavior of our rulebook.

<p>
<p>The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hand-ranking rules is a rulebook. The hand-ranking rules have outcomes royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, high card.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the flushness.
<br>The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the straightness.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the pair count.
<br>The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the triple count.
<br>The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the quadruple count.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player's hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on &quot;Looking at containment by hand&quot; in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player's hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player's hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A card can be sorted or unsorted. A card is usually unsorted.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a card is high if its rank is 11 or more.
<br>Definition: a card is low if its rank is 4 or less.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the initial sort rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every card is unsorted;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the player carries an unsorted card
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let item be the lowest unsorted card held by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move item to the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the item is sorted;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end while;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if sort-debugging is true, say &quot;-- after initial sort: [list hand]&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we'll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it's on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.
<p>
<p>Next up, a check to see whether the player has a flush:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the finding flushness rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let called suit be the suit of a random card carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if every card carried by the player is called suit, change flushness to true.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now we check for straights; this is slightly complicated by the fact that an ace can be either the bottom of a low straight (lower than 2) or the top of a high straight (higher than king), so we explicitly check both possibilities.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the finding straightness rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change straightness to true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be the rank of the highest card which is carried by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with current rank running from N - 4 to N
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change the test rank to the current rank;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the player carries a matching card
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the current rank is N - 4 and the current rank is 9 and the player carries an ace card, do nothing; [this covers the case where an ace could be the top card of the sequence]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise change straightness to false;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player's hand when we take inventory.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A card can be quadrupled, tripled, paired or uncombined.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test rank is a number that varies. Definition: a card is matching if its rank is the test rank.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>This definition is a convenience so that we don't have to write so many explicit loops in the following rule:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the counting multiples rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every card is uncombined;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeat with current rank running from 1 to 13
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change test rank to current rank;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let N be the number of matching cards held by the player;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if N is 4
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the quadruple count by 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every matching card held by the player is quadrupled;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if N is 3
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the triple count by 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every matching card held by the player is tripled;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if N is 2
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begin;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the pair count by 1;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every matching card held by the player is paired;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end repeat;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:
<p>
<p>1) we want to list aces as high unless they are serving as the bottom of a low straight, in which case they should appear last;
<p>
<p>2) we want combinations to appear at the front of the list, sorted from highest value to lowest value: larger combinations first, then smaller combinations, and combinations of equal size sorted by rank.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the move aces up unless there's a low straight rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the straightness is true and the lowest card carried by the player is an ace card and the rank of the highest card carried by the player is 5,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do nothing;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now every ace card which is carried by the player is carried by the player;

<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Definition: a card is ace if its rank is 1.
<br>Definition: a card is king if its rank is 13.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Now, having determined the salient qualities of our hand, we run through rules in order from the highest kind of poker combination to the lowest. Because of the order of the source, Inform will choose whichever combination applies first.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the royal-flush rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if flushness is true and straightness is true and the highest card carried by the player is king and the lowest card carried by the player is ace, royal flush.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the straight-flushes rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if flushness is true and straightness is true, straight flush.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the four-of-a-kind rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the quadruple count is 1, four of a kind.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the full-house rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the pair count is 1 and the triple count is 1, full house.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the flushes rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if flushness is true, flush.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the straights rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if straightness is true, straight.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the three-of-a-kind rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if triple count is 1, three of a kind.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the two-pair rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the pair count is 2, two pairs.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the pair rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the pair count is 1, pair.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">A hand-ranking rule (this is the default rule):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high card.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>And finally, we need to define our debugging variable here, even though we won't give the player the ability to turn it on and off except in the special testing section.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Sort-debugging is a truth state that varies.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For many examples, a test-me script is enough to prove that the example does what it ought. This example, though, is a bit more complicated, and hard to test randomly. The remainder of the source here shows how we might write a test to verify the desired behavior of our rulebook. Those who are only interested in the rulebook itself can stop reading at this point.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Section 5 - Testing hand identification - Not for release
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>For the sake of testing our rules, we provide an apparatus that will load the player's hand up with sample hands of each kind, then show the result to make sure that the hand is being correctly identified.
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Understand &quot;debug sorting&quot; as debugging hand sorting. Debugging hand sorting is an action out of world.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Carry out debugging hand sorting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if sort-debugging is false, now sort-debugging is true;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise now sort-debugging is false.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Report debugging hand sorting:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say &quot;Sort debugging is now [if sort-debugging is true]on[otherwise]off[end if].&quot;
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">Test me with &quot;draw / g / g / g / g / force hand / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g / g&quot;.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>The somewhat rough-and-ready principle of this table is that we will overwrite the cards in the player's hand by resetting their ranks and suits; every five rows of the table represent a new poker hand for the game to attempt to sort and identify. These include one example of each of the major kinds of poker hand, plus a couple of variations involving aces which test the special sorting rules.
