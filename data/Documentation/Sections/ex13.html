New conditions, new adjectives</b></font></td></tr></table>
<p>
<p>We can create new conditions by defining a phrase with &quot;to decide whether&quot; (or equivalently &quot;to decide if&quot;):
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">To decide whether danger lurks:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if in darkness then decide yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Control Room has been visited then decide no;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide yes.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>As can be seen, such a phrase must always resolve itself with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;: the first to be reached will be the answer. For instance, if the player is indeed in darkness, the decision is &quot;yes&quot; because the &quot;decide yes&quot; stops the process right there. We can now write, for instance,
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080">if danger lurks then ...
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>In fact, &quot;danger lurks&quot; is now a condition as good as any other, and can be used wherever a condition would be given. Rules can apply only &quot;when danger lurks&quot;, for instance.
<p>
<p>We can also supply definitions of adjectives like this. So far, new adjectives have been defined like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode27(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode27()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>If we want to give a definition which involves more complex logic, we can use a special form allowing us to make arbitrary decisions. In this longer format, the same definition would look like so:
<p>
<blockquote><font color="#000080"><script language="JavaScript">
function pasteCode28(code) {
    var myProject = external.Project;

    myProject.selectView('source');
    myProject.pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied:\n\tif it is undescribed then decide no;\n\tif something is on it then decide yes;\n\tdecide no.\n\n');
}
</script>
<a href="javascript:pasteCode28()"><img border=0 src=../doc_images/paste.png></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it is undescribed then decide no;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if something is on it then decide yes;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decide no.
</font></blockquote><p>
<p>
<p>Here &quot;it&quot; refers to the supporter in question. Note that there are now two colons in this sentence, one after &quot;Definition&quot;, the other after the clause being defined. But that apart, it's a phrase like any other: it must end in &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; just as the &quot;danger lurks&quot; example must.

<p>
<p>Suppose we want the game to interpret &quot;GO OUT&quot; as &quot;move towards an outdoors room, or towards a room with more exits than the current room&quot;, while &quot;GO IN&quot; means &quot;move toward a room with fewer exits, or towards an indoors room&quot;. Thus going in repeatedly within a building would lead towards dead-ends, while going out repeatedly would lead towards the center of the building and then towards an exit to the outside world.
<p>
<p>We start by encoding these rules as definitions:
