---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Punctuation Removal provides phrases for removing unwanted punctuation marks from the player's command before attempting to interpret it. These are

	remove exclamation points
	remove question marks
	remove quotes

and, to do all three of these things at once,

	remove stray punctuation.

These phrases should be used during the After reading a command activity, so for instance in a game designed to be very patient with the player's quirks:

	After reading a command:
		remove stray punctuation.
		
Example: * Patience - In which question and exclamation marks are pulled from the player's input.

	"Patience"

	The Overpunctuation Arena is a room. "It's madness in here!! Fortunately, you have a lot of patience, right???"
	
	Understand "who is/are [text]" as inquiring about. Inquiring about is an action applying to one topic. Carry out inquiring about a topic listed in the Table of Answers: say "[reply entry][paragraph break]". Understand the command "what" as "who".
	
	Table of Answers
	topic	reply
	"patience"	"A virtue."
	"virtue" or "a virtue"	"A grace."
	"Grace" or "a grace"	"A little girl who doesn't wash her face."
	
	After reading a command:
		remove stray punctuation;
		if the player's command includes "&", replace the matched text with "and".
	
	Test me with "what is patience? / what is a virtue?! / what is grace???"
